# üìß Email Testing Guide for SFGM Boston

## üö® IMPORTANT: EmailJS Server-Side Limitation

EmailJS does NOT work from server-side code (Node.js). It only works from browser/client-side code. This is a security feature of EmailJS.

## üß™ How to Test Your Emails

### Option 1: Browser Test Page (RECOMMENDED)
I've created a test page that you can use to test all email types:

1. **Open the test page**: `test-emails-browser.html` (should be open in your browser)
2. **Click the test buttons** to send emails to:
   - `n1kaslov@gmail.com` (welcome email and event notification)
   - `pastor_rocky@sfgm.boston.com` (admin notification and essay submission)

### Option 2: Manual Testing via Registration
1. **Go to**: `http://localhost:56000/register`
2. **Register a new user** with email consent enabled
3. **Check emails** at both addresses

### Option 3: EmailJS Dashboard Testing
1. **Log into EmailJS Dashboard**
2. **Go to Email Templates**
3. **Test each template** with sample data

## üîß Current EmailJS Configuration

- **Service ID**: `service_tbjkat8`
- **Public Key**: `UPTEDM8MNxgzaRzV3`
- **Welcome Template**: `template_7aa3jen` (existing - needs update)
- **Events Template**: `template_events` (needs to be created)
- **Essays Template**: `template_essays` (needs to be created)
- **Admin Template**: `template_admin` (needs to be created)

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Update/Create EmailJS Templates** using the content above
2. **Test using the browser page** (`test-emails-browser.html`)
3. **Verify emails are received** at both addresses
4. **Test the actual registration flow** to ensure automatic emails work

## üö® Important Notes

- **EmailJS only works from browser** - not from server-side code
- **Templates must be created** in EmailJS dashboard before emails will work
- **Test with the browser page first** before testing the full system
- **Check spam folders** if emails don't arrive immediately
