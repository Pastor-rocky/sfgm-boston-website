CHAPTER 3: THE SERVANT IN MOTION 
Where Your Calling Meets the Crowd
You’ve felt the nudge. You’ve built the foundation.
Now... it’s time to MOVE.
This chapter is where your character meets your calling. Where preparation meets 
purpose. This is about what deacons DO—not out of duty, but out of a Spirit-filled 
overflow of love and power. 

We believe true ministry happens not just in the pulpit, but in the parking lot. Not 
just during the sermon, but during the setup. Not just in prayer, but in practical 
acts of love that make God’s presence tangible.
Ready to serve? Let’s go.
1. THE MINISTRY OF COMPASSION: HANDS THAT HEAL 
This is the heart of the diaconate. It’s not paperwork—it’s people-work.
Visiting the Sick & Hurting:
    You’re the one bringing prayer, presence, and practical help to hospital rooms 
and homes.
    “Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over 
them...” (James 5:14 NLT).
    Often, you are the first responder—the hands and heart of Jesus in moments of 
crisis.
Benevolence & Practical Care:
    You help coordinate food, resources, and financial assistance for those in 
temporary need.
    This is living out “If one of you says, ‘Go in peace; stay warm and eat well,’ but 
does not provide for their physical needs, what good is it?” (James 2:16 NLT).
    You turn empathy into action.
Funeral & Grief Support:
    You walk with families through loss—helping with services, offering comfort, and 
being a stable, compassionate presence.
    You embody “He comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others...” 
(2 Corinthians 1:4 NLT).

2. THE MINISTRY OF THE HOUSE: BEHIND-THE-SCENES EXCELLENCE 

Sunday morning doesn’t happen by magic. It happens by anointed administration.
Facilities & Logistics:
    You ensure the house of God is clean, functional, and welcoming. Setting up 
chairs, checking sound systems, managing overflow rooms—it’s all worship when 
done unto the Lord.
    “God is not a God of disorder but of peace...” (1 Corinthians 14:33 NLT). Your 
service brings order so the Spirit can flow in peace.
Service Coordination:
    You help with baptisms, communion, offerings, and greeting. You’re not just 
doing tasks—you’re facilitating encounters with God.
    You help “everything be done in a fitting and orderly way” (1 Corinthians 14:40 
NLT).
Security & Safety:
    You protect the flock. Watching the doors, monitoring the crowd, being aware—
you create a safe space for people to worship without fear.
    You are a guardian of the atmosphere.
3. THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD: WHEN DEACONS SPEAK 

Yes, deacons serve—but sometimes, that service includes declaring truth.
Reading Scripture Publicly:
    You may be called to read God’s Word during service. This isn’t just reciting 
words—it’s releasing revelation.
    “Faith comes from hearing, that is, hearing the Good News about Christ” 
(Romans 10:17 NLT). Your voice helps carry that faith.
Testifying & Witnessing:
    Sharing your story isn’t just encouraged—it’s essential. Your testimony of God’s 
grace, especially through your own journey of restoration, has power.
    “They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their 
testimony...” (Revelation 12:11 NLT).
Assisting in Teaching & Discipleship:
    You may help lead small groups, mentor new believers, or teach foundational 
classes.

    This is where you “equip God’s people to do his work” (Ephesians 4:12 NLT).
4. THE HEART BEHIND THE HANDS: WHY IT ALL MATTERS 
Don’t ever think setting up a chair is less spiritual than preaching a sermon.
It’s All Worship:
    When you serve with a heart of love, you are worshiping. “Whatever you do, 
work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord...” (Colossians 3:23 NLT).
    That includes stacking chairs and passing microphones.
You Are an Atmosphere Shifter:
    Your attitude sets the tone. When you serve with joy, peace, and excellence, you 
literally shift the spiritual atmosphere of the house.
    People feel the difference when love is in the details.
You Make Ministry Multiplication Possible:
    Just like in Acts 6, your practical service frees up pastors and teachers to focus 
on prayer and the Word.
    You are a force multiplier in the kingdom.
A TESTIMONY: FROM SET-UP TO SENDING 
I’ll never forget the first time I was asked to help with communion. It seemed 
simple—pass the tray, collect the cups. But that day, as I served the body and 
blood of Jesus to His people, the Holy Spirit hit me. 
I wasn’t just handing out bread and juice.
I was facilitating an encounter with the living God.
In that moment, serving felt as sacred as preaching.
That’s the beauty of this calling. There are no small roles—only sacred 
opportunities.
Whether you’re visiting a shut-in, running a cable, or praying with a newcomer, you 
are Jesus’ hands and feet.
You’re not working for God—you’re working with Him.
YOUR CHAPTER 3 CHALLENGE 
This week, find one practical way to serve at your church—and do it with all your 
heart.

Help park cars. 
Greet people at the door. 
Ask your pastor where a need exists behind the scenes. 
Do it quietly. Do it joyfully. Do it as unto the Lord.
That’s where your ministry begins.
Now go—serve in power.
