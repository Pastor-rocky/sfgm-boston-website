CHAPTER 2: LAYING THE FOUNDATION 
Building a Life That Can Hold the Weight of Your Calling
You said “yes” to the nudge. You acknowledged the whisper of the Holy Spirit. 
That’s powerful. But what happens next? How do you move from a stirring in your 
spirit to a life fully prepared to walk in the authority, responsibility, and anointing of 
a deacon?
This chapter is where we get real about preparation. 
This isn’t just about completing a checklist or jumping through religious hoops. 
This is about building a spiritual, moral, and practical foundation so strong that 
when God promotes you, you won’t crack under the pressure. You won’t just hold 
the title—you’ll embody the calling.
We believe the preparation process is holy. It’s not a barrier; it’s a divine 
safeguard. It’s where God transforms your potential into His proven vessel.
Let’s build.

 PART 1: THE NON-NEGOTIABLES – GOD’S BLUEPRINT FOR SERVANT-
LEADERS
Before you look at applications, timelines, or ministry descriptions, you must first 
look into the mirror of Scripture. God’s standards are not up for debate. They’re 
the framework for faithfulness.
1 Timothy 3:8-13 (NLT)
“In the same way, deacons must be well respected and have integrity. They must 
not be heavy drinkers or dishonest with money. They must be committed to the 
mystery of the faith now revealed and must live with a clear conscience. Before 
they are appointed as deacons, let them be closely examined. If they pass the test, 
then let them serve as deacons. In the same way, their wives must be respected 
and must not slander others. They must exercise self-control and be faithful in 
everything they do. A deacon must be faithful to his wife, and he must manage his 
children and household well. Those who do well as deacons will be rewarded with 
respect from others and will have increased confidence in their faith in Christ 
Jesus.”
Let’s break down 1 Timothy 3:8-13 (NLT) – the deacon job and his Wife. Let’s 
break it down. Point by point. Scripture by scripture.
1. MUST BE RESPECTED

“They must be respected” (1 Timothy 3:8 NLT)
This isn’t about being popular. It’s about earning trust through consistency.
Do you keep your word?
Are you punctual?
Do people confidently rely on you?
Is your character solid in public and private?
Respect isn’t demanded. It’s cultivated through integrity.
2. MUST HAVE INTEGRITY
“Sincere” (1 Timothy 3:8 NLT)
Integrity means you’re the same person in the dark as you are in the light.
No hidden lives.
No double-mindedness.
What you preach on Sunday is what you live on Monday.
People follow leaders they trust. Trust is built on raw, unwavering authenticity.
3. CAN’T BE A HEAVY DRINKER
“Not a heavy drinker” (1 Timothy 3:8 NLT)
This isn’t about legalism—it’s about clarity and self-control.
Anything that clouds your judgment, alters your behavior, or damages your witness 
has no place in your life.
Drinking
Drugs
Gambling
You must be Spirit-controlled, not substance-influenced.
Your mind must be shar p, your spirit aler t. 
易⚡
4. CAN’T BE DISHONEST WITH MONEY
“Not pursuing dishonest gain” (1 Timothy 3:8 NLT)
You can’t ser ve God and money.
No shady side deals. 
No exploiting your role for personal benefit.
You handle church funds, offerings, and resources with terrifying honesty.

Money tests the heart. Pass the test.
5. MUST BE COMMITTED TO THE FAITH
“Cling to the mystery of the faith...” (1 Timothy 3:9 NLT)
This is about doctrinal faithfulness and spiritual loyalty.
You know what you believe and why you believe it.
You’re committed to the truth of God’s Word, not the trends of culture.
You’re all in. No wavering. No compromise.
Your foundation is the Word, and you stand on it—no matter what.
6. MUST HAVE A CLEAR CONSCIENCE
“With a clear conscience” (1 Timothy 3:9 NLT)
No guilt. No unconfessed sin. No unresolved relationships.
You keep shor t accounts with God and people.
You repent quickly. You forgive deeply.
You walk in freedom, not condemnation.
Your inner world must be clean so your outer ministry can be powerful.
7. MUST GO THROUGH TESTING
“They must first be tested” (1 Timothy 3:10 NLT)
You don’t star t at the top. You prove yourself faithful in the small things first.
Can you serve when no one sees?
Can you follow before you lead?
Can you handle criticism, delay, and spiritual attack without quitting?
Te s t i n g   i s n ’ t   p u n i s h m e n t .   I t ’s   p re p a r a t i o n .
8. THE HUSBAND MUST BE FAITHFUL TO HIS WIFE
“He must be faithful to his wife” (1 Timothy 3:12 NLT)
Your mar riage is a mir ror of your ministr y.
Emotional and physical faithfulness are non-negotiable.
You honor, cherish, and protec t your covenant.
Your love for your wife reflec ts Christ ’s love for the church.
If you can’t lead at home, you can’t lead in the church.
9. MUST MANAGE CHILDREN & HOUSEHOLD WELL

“Manage his children and his household well.” (1 Timothy 3:12 NLT)
Leadership starts at home.
Your kids respect you—not because they fear you, but because they trust you.
Your home is a place of peace, prayer, and purpose—not chaos or compromise.
You don’t sacrifice your family on the altar of ministry.
Your first ministry is your household.
10. HIS WIFE MUST BE RESPECTED
“Their wives must be respected” (1 Timothy 3:11 NLT)
She’s not an accessory. She’s a partner.
Her character matters. Her reputation is clean.
She carries herself with grace, wisdom, and strength.
She is honored not because of who she’s married to—but because of who she is.
11. SHE MUST NOT BE A SLANDERER
“Must not slander others” (1 Timothy 3:11 NLT)
She builds up—never tears down.
No gossip. No trash-talking. No hidden criticisms.
Her words bring life, healing, and unity.
She guards her tongue like she guards her heart.
12. SHE MUST HAVE SELF-CONTROL
“Exercise self-control” (1 Timothy 3:11 NLT)
She is emotionally and spiritually disciplined.
She doesn’t react—she responds.
She isn’t controlled by moods or impulses.
She walks in the Spirit, not the flesh.
13. SHE MUST BE FAITHFUL IN EVERYTHING
“Be faithful in everything she does” (1 Timothy 3:11 NLT)
To t a l   t r u s t wo r t h i n e s s .
She is dependable.
Her yes means yes. Her no means no.
In public, in private, in ministry, in friendship—she is consistently faithful.
BOTTOM LINE:
God isn’t looking for perfect people.
He’s looking for trustworthy people.

You don’t have to have it all together right now.
But you do have to be willing to grow.
This isn’t a list of rules to restrict you— It’s a picture of a life so free, so full of 
integrity, so saturated with the Spirit... that people see Jesus when they see you.
If this stirps you, challenges you, or even intimidates you— good. That means the 
Holy Spirit is speaking.
Now... let’s get to work.

PART 3: BEYOND THE PROCESS – CULTIVATING A DEACON’S HEART
The steps above are important, but if you only do the outward steps without letting 
God work on your heart, you’ll become a hollow leader. Here’s how to cultivate the 
inner life of a deacon:
Your Private Prayer Life Deter mines Your Public Spiritual Authority
 
You can’t give what you don’t have. If you’not spending consistent, authentic time 
with Jesus, you’ll minister out of memory, not presence.
Serve When No One Is Watching
Anyone can serve on Sunday morning. True servants also serve on Tuesday 
afternoon when no one applauds. That’s where God does His deepest work.
Become a Student of the Word—Not Just a Reader
“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly” (Colossians 3:16). Let it change you. 
Confront you. Shape your thoughts, words, and reactions.
Guard Your Heart Above All Else

  “Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.” (Proverbs 
4:23 NIV). Your greatest responsibility is to protect your inner world from 
bitterness, offense, pride, and compromise.

 PART 4: TESTIMONY – WHEN GOD BUILDS YOUR CHARACTER BEFORE 
YOUR PLATFORM
My own preparation season was humbling. I thought I was ready. I’d been serving. I 
knew the Bible. I loved Jesus.

●

●
But i had areas of pride, pockets of immaturity . There were moments I felt 
frustrated, because I thought I had all the answers.
So I needed to be humbled
But God was merciful. He didn’t let me step into a space I wasn’t ready to hold.
During that season, I learned to follow before I could lead. I learned that spiritual 
authority isn’t taken—it’s earned through faithfulness, humility, and trust.
That season of preparation became the most important part of my journey. It 
wasn’t what I did—it was what God did in me.
He taught me to lead by example and it was one of the most important lessons of 
my life.
Your preparation is your protec tion.
Your process is your promise.
Your faithfulness is your foundation.

 YOUR CHAPTER 2 ASSIGNMENT
Don’t just read this—engage with it.
Pray Over 1 Timothy 3:8-13
Ask the Holy Spirit: “Which of these areas are You highlighting in my life right now? 
What needs to change?” Write down what He says. 

Have the Conversation
If you haven’t already, go to your pastor or a leader at HRM this week. Say, “I 
believe God is calling me into deeper service. I want to start the process. What is 
my next step?”
Find a Secret Place to Serve
This week, do something kind, helpful, or generous for someone at church—and 
tell no one. Let it be between you and God. That’s where pure ministry begins.
You are not ear ning your calling.
You are building your capacity to carry it.
He who called you is faithful.
He will do it.
