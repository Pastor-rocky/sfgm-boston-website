CHAPTER 5: COMMISSIONED FOR IMPACT 
Stepping Into Your Lifelong Assignment
You’ve discer ned the call.
You’ve built the foundation.
You’ve ser ved faithfully.
You’ve stood in spiritual war fare.
Now... it’s time to step fully into why God called you.
This chapter isn’t about finishing—it’s about fulfilling. Ordination isn’t a graduation 
ceremony; it’s a deployment. It’s where you move from preparation to purpose, 
from training to transformation.
We don’t see ordination as the end of a process. We see it as the beginning of 
your legacy.
Let’s step into your commissioning.
1. WHAT ORDINATION REALLY MEANS: MORE THAN A TITLE 

This moment is spiritual before it’s ceremonial.
A Public Affirmation of a Private Calling:
  This is where your pastors and spiritual family stand up and say, “We see God in 
you. We confirm what Heaven has already spoken.”
  “Do not neglect the spiritual gift you received through the prophecy spoken over 
you when the elders of the church laid their hands on you” (1 Timothy 4:14 NLT).
An Impartation of Grace and Authority:
  When hands are laid on you, something supernatural happens. There’s a transfer
—of grace, covering, and spiritual authority to walk in your calling.
  You’re not just approved by people; you’re anointed by God.
A Covenant Moment:
  You’re not just committing to a role; you’re entering a covenant with God and His 
church. This is a sacred trust.
  You’re saying “yes” to a lifetime of representing Jesus well.
2. YOUR FIRST YEAR: STAYING HUMBLE, STAYING POWERFUL 


Your first year as an ordained deacon will set the tone for decades to come.
Serve, Don’t Strive:
  You don’t have to prove anything. You’ve already been approved. Now, serve from 
a place of restful confidence, not nervous performance.
Keep Learning:
  You never graduate from being a student of Jesus. Stay hungry. Sit under 
teaching. Ask questions. Let your pastors and mentors continue to shape you.
Protect Your Heart:
  Promotion can bring pride. Stay accountable. Stay repentant. Stay close to Jesus.
  “Pride goes before destruction, and haughtiness before a fall” (Proverbs 16:18 
NLT).
3. LIFELONG MINISTRY: HOW TO FINISH FAITHFULLY 
This isn’t a short-term assignment. This is a lifetime legacy.
Leave a Mark, Not a Title:
  People may forget your name, but they’ll never forget how you made them feel—
seen, loved, served, and valued.
  That’s how you turn service into eternal impact.
Multiply Yourself:
  Your greatest legacy won’t be what you did—it will be who you raised up.
  Train others. Empower the next generation. Don’t build your kingdom—build His.
Never Stop Worshiping:
  It’s easy to serve God and forget to love God. Stay in awe of Him. Let your private 
worship fuel your public service.
4. BEYOND THE DEACONATE: WHERE GOD MAY TAKE YOU 
Your faithfulness here opens doors you can’t imagine.
For some, the deaconate is a lifelong assignment.
For others, it’s a divine training ground for what’s next.
I never thought serving as a deacon would lead me to pastoring. But God used 
every act of service—every chair set up, every prayer prayed, every need met—to 
prepare me for more.

Your obedience in this season doesn’t limit your future—it launches it.
“If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones...” (Luke 16:10 
NLT).
A FINAL CHARGE: YOUR STORY IS JUST BEGINNING 
When I walked back into that church after my season of wandering, I had no idea 
what God had in store. I just knew I was saying “yes” again.
That “yes” led to serving.
That serving led to ordination.
That ordination led to greater trust.
That trust led to pastoring.
And it all started with a nudge.
Your story is still being written.
Your greatest moments of ministry are still ahead.
Your obedience today is shaping your legacy tomorrow.
So go—set up the chairs.
Visit the sick.
Pray with the hurting.
Lead with love.
Serve with joy.
Do it all for Jesus.
You are called.
You are anointed.
You are commissioned.
Now go change your world.
“Now may the God of peace... equip you with all you need for doing his will. May 
he produce in you, through the power of Jesus Christ, every good thing that is 
pleasing to him. All glory to him forever and ever! Amen.”
— Hebrews 13:20–21 NLT
