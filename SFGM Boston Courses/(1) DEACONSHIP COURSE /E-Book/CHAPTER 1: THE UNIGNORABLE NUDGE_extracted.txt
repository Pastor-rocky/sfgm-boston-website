CHAPTER 1: THE UNIGNORABLE NUDGE
Is This Your Call to Serve?
Life is loud. Between work, family, social demands, and the endless scroll through 
your phone, it’s easy to miss it—that quiet, persistent whisper of the Holy Spirit.
This isn’t a voice of guilt. 
It’s not a voice of religious pressure.  It’s an invitation. 
Maybe you feel it during worship—when the presence of God is thick and your 
spirit feels awake. 
Maybe it hits when you see a practical need at church and something in you says, 
“I should do something about that.” 
That nudge? It matters.
It might be the first sign of a divine assignment. 
This chapter is all about tuning out the noise so you can clearly hear that whisper
—and having the boldness to ask:
“Holy Spirit... is this You?” 

At SFGM Boston (HRM), we live by a powerful truth:
✨
 True ministry begins LONG before a title does. 
✨
It starts with a heart that says “YES” and hands that are ready to work.
THE BLUEPRINT: WHAT IS A DEACON? 
里
This isn’t some man-made role.
It’s a Spirit-orchestrated assignment designed to bring order, power, and grace to 
the local church.
The first deacons were appointed in Acts 6—“full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom”—
to handle practical needs so the apostles could focus on prayer and preaching the 
Word. Their anointed service brought UNITY and caused the Word of God to 
multiply. 
A deacon is, at its core, a Spirit-empowered servant. That means:

 PRACTICAL ANOINTING:
You’re the hands and feet of the church —doing good works that bring God glory. 
It’s faith in action.
“I will show you my faith by my good deeds.” (James 2:18 NLT)


 A BRIDGE OF COMPASSION:
You connect truth with need. You’re love in motion—not just in words, but in 
action.
“Let us not love with words or speech, but with actions and in truth.” (1 John 3:18 
NLT)

 A STANDARD OF HOLINESS:
The bar is high. Deacons must be:
worthy of respect sincere not heavy drinkers not greedy holding to the faith with a 
clear conscience (See 1 Timothy 3:8–9 NLT)
This calling is about radical obedience—not personal elevation.
DISCERNING THE CALL: IS THIS THE SPIRIT? 
吝
How do you know if this pull is from God? The Holy Spirit gives WITNESSES. 
Here’s what to look for:
❤
 AN INCLINED HEART:
Do you feel a deep desire to meet the needs of others? That’s often your first clue.
“God has given each of you a gift. Use it well to serve one another.” (1 Peter 4:10 
NLT)
☮
 THE WITNESS OF PEACE:
As you pray about this, does God’s peace—which “exceeds anything we can 
understand” (Philippians 4:7 NLT)—guard your heart?
Fear and confusion are from the enemy.
Peace is from God.

 GODLY CONFIRMATION:
This is non-negotiable. You MUST talk to your spiritual leaders.
“Without wise leadership, a nation falls; but with many counselors, there is safety.” 
(Proverbs 11:14 NLT)
Submitting to leadership isn’t a suggestion—it’s protection.
TAKING THE FIRST STEP 

You don’t need full clarity to take the first step. You just need to respond to what 
God is showing you now.

Approach your pastor or a leader and say something like:
“I’ve been praying, and I feel the Holy Spirit might be calling me to serve more 
deeply. Can we talk and pray about this together?” 

That’s it. That simple act of humility and faith opens the door for God to bring 
greater clarity—and for your leaders to stand with you.
A TESTIMONY OF GRACE & CALLING
Let me keep it real with you.
Long before I was a pastor, I felt that Holy Spirit nudge. I didn’t wait for a title—I 
just started SERVING. Setting up chairs, helping families, doing whatever was 
needed. I learned that the anointing to serve is a real and powerful gift.
But my journey wasn’t all smooth. I hit a rough season. Took a wrong turn. Stepped 
away from church. For a while, I thought I’d lost my chance—and my calling.
But even in that wilderness, I found out something undeniable:
God’s gifts and His call can never be withdrawn. (Romans 11:29 NLT)
Even when I wasn’t in church, I was still helping people. Still praying for people. I 
was a deacon in the desert—and God never let go of me.
My comeback wasn’t based on my performance—but on God’s mercy and 
faithfulness. When I returned, I got back into serving. I was ordained as a deacon. 
Then God promoted me to elder. And eventually, to pastor.
Your past doesn’t disqualify you—it equips you.
God doesn’t call the qualified.
He qualifies the called.
“For I know the plans I have for you,” says the Lord. “They are plans for good and 
not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.” (Jeremiah 29:11 NLT)
That future includes your service.
If you feel that nudge—don’t ignore it.
Bring it to God.
Then bring it to your leaders.
Let’s seek God together.
This could be your next powerful chapter.

Your assignment is waiting.
