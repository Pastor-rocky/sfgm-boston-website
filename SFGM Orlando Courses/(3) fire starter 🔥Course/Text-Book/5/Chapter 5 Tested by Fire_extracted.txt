Chapter 5: Tested by Fire
" And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the 
kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: where 
their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. For every one shall be salted 
with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. Salt is good: but if the salt 
have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and 
have peace one with another." (Mark 9:47–50, KJV)
The Good News Translation renders Mark 9:49 this way: "Everyone will be purified 
(tested) by fire as a sacrifice is purified by salt."
In these verses Jesus first warns about what we let our eyes look upon, then He 
moves to how a believer is tested. We just discussed guarding our eyes in the 
previous chapter; now let’s look at how believers are tested by God’s fire for His 
glory.
Why are believers tested in the first place?
"Be glad about this, even though it may now be necessary for you to be sad for a 
while because of the many kinds of trials you suffer. Their purpose is to prove that 
your faith is genuine. Even gold, which can be destroyed, is tested by fire; and so 
your faith, which is much more precious than gold, must also be tested, so that it 
may endure. Then you will receive praise and glory and honor on the Day when 
Jesus Christ is revealed." (1 Peter 1:6–7)
The Greek word for trials here is peirasmos. Thayer’s definitions include:
trial, proving integrity, virtue, constancy adversity, affliction, trouble sent by God 
and serving to test or prove one’s character, faith, and holiness
In Mark 9, Jesus also speaks of salt—our witness for Christ. 
Why must a person be tested? So our witness shines. As Peter says, just as gold is 
tested by fire to purify it, our lives before God must be purified. The more fire, the 
more purity is revealed—in the gold and in us. The result is integrity, virtue, faith, 
and holiness. God wants you to be the real deal. Too many so-called Christians 
bless the Lord when all is well, but bail when things get hard, and that’s why the 
fire burns out in their lives.
Luke 8 describes it perfectly: "The seeds that fell on rocky ground stand for those 
who hear the message and receive it gladly. But it does not sink deep into them; 
they believe only for a while, but when the time of testing comes, they fall away." 
(Luke 8:13)
We need to embrace the fire, not run from it. The book of Malachi gives us an 
awesome example:
"But who can abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he 

appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap: and he will sit as a 
refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as 
gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness." 
(Malachi 3:2–3)
Notice it says He will "sit" as a refiner. A refiner sits to ensure two things happen. 
First, he uses a screen-like tool to skim away dross (impurities) as heat brings 
them to the surface, setting apart what is bad from what is good. When the fires of 
trial rise in your life, words may come out that shouldn’t, thoughts may arise that 
aren’t right, actions or habits may surface that aren’t pleasing to God. 
He wants you to see them, bring them to Him, and let Him remove them so you can 
live a sanctified life.
Second, the refiner sits to make sure the gold or silver isn’t ruined. "If you think 
you are standing firm you had better be careful that you do not fall. Every test that 
you have experienced is the kind that normally comes to people. But God keeps 
his promise, and he will not allow you to be tested beyond your power to remain 
firm; at the time you are put to the test, he will give you the strength to endure it, 
and so provide you with a way out." (1 Corinthians 10:12–13)
God does not want you to fail. He wants you to succeed, and He will help you.
"Israel, the Lord who created you says, Do not be afraid—I will save you. I have 
called you by name—you are mine. When you pass through deep waters, I will be 
with you; your troubles will not overwhelm you. When you pass through fire, you 
will not be burned; the hard trials that come will not hurt you." (Isaiah 43:1–2)
You might say, I’ve been tested too much. Keep believing and waiting—God will get 
you through. But make sure it’s a test and not discipline. Many confuse the two: 
they commit adultery, lie, cheat, live according to the flesh, and then say, "I’m 
going through some trials." No—that’s discipline. Repent, and God will stop the 
discipline.
"For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a 
meddler in other men’s matters: but if a man suffers as a Christian, let him not be 
ashamed; but let him glorify God in this name." (1 Peter 4:15–16)
Here’s a story that brings the refiner’s picture to life:
There was a group of women in a Bible study on Malachi. As they studied chapter 
3, they came across verse 3: "He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver." The 
statement puzzled them. One woman offered to find out more about refining silver 
and report back.
She visited a silversmith and watched him at work. Without explaining her reason, 
she observed as he held a piece of silver over the fire, letting it heat up. He 
explained that to refine silver, he must hold it in the middle of the fire where the 
flames are hottest to burn away all impurities.

She thought about God holding us in such a hot spot—and then about the verse 
that says He sits as a refiner. She asked if he really had to sit the entire time the 
silver was in the fire. "Yes," he said. He not only had to sit and hold the silver, but 
he had to keep his eyes on it the whole time. If left even a moment too long, the 
silver would be destroyed.
She asked, "How do you know when the silver is fully refined?" He smiled: "Oh, 
that’s easy—when I see my image in it."
This is especially meaningful for those in the hottest part of the flame right now. 
God’s eyes are fixed on those He is refining. Nothing in your life goes unnoticed by 
the Father. He is aware of all—and He is for you. Jesus will allow strong fires of 
testing until He—and everyone else—sees His image, His character, in your life.
There’s a story in Daniel that shows people seeing Jesus in your life through trials. 
Three Hebrew men were carried to Babylon and taught its ways. The king made a 
golden idol and commanded all to bow when the music sounded. The three 
refused, because it was against God’s law. Summoned before the king, they still 
would not bow. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego said:
"O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter. If it be so, our 
God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will 
deliver us out of thy hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we 
will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."
In fury, the king ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter and had the three 
bound and thrown in. The fire was so hot it killed the men who threw them in. But 
then:
"Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?" They answered, 
"True, O king." He said, "Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, 
and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods." Then 
he called them out, and Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth from the 
fire. (Daniel 3:16–26, selections)
They came out unharmed and loosed. The only thing that burned was the ropes—
and the ones who threw them in. When you go through a test of fire without 
bowing to the world or giving in to the enemy—even if God doesn’t change the 
situation—and you can say like they did, "Even if God doesn’t deliver me, I will not 
give in, I will not let go, I will not bow," then the only thing that will burn are the 
bondages that tried to hold you. The enemy won’t touch you because you 
submitted to God through testing by fire. You will go through the fire without being 
burned. And like the refiner’s fire, people will see Jesus in you. The people saw a 
visitation of Jesus in the middle of the fire, protecting them with His holy fire.
Many don’t realize that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego’s Hebrew names were 
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah (see Daniel 2:17). Hananiah means "favor," Mishael 

means "like God," and Azariah means "the Lord helps." The king gave them 
Babylonian names after Babylon’s gods. Their character stood firm. They had 
God’s favor—right after they came out, the king promoted them. He also declared 
that no other god could save like the God of the Hebrews. God helped them—and 
because of this, people saw the Son of God in their lives.
Another reason God allows tests of fire is to promote you. Don’t be discouraged—
your setback might be a set-up.
Here is the biggest test I’ve gone through. In August 2005, I received a call that my 
mother was brain-dead in the hospital, and people said her husband did it. I flew 
to New York. I saw my mother full of tubes, with cuts and scrapes on her arms and 
neck. I remembered two weeks earlier she told me, "Anthony, this man is going to 
kill me; he put a knife to my throat and cut me." I was looking at those scars. She 
had asked me for money, and I had said no because I was upset she stayed with 
him, even though I warned her.
I prayed and fasted for days, asking God for strength not to lose it, because her 
husband was at the hospital the whole time. One day he came into the room. I 
stood up, and God put such peace on me. He talked about praying to some saint, 
and I told him the only way to the Father is Jesus. As days passed, God worked on 
me. One day, reading Jeremiah—"vengeance is the Lord’s"—I knew what God 
wanted me to do.
Days later my family decided to remove life support. God gave me peace about it. 
The doctors said there was no way she would recover, even though I knew God 
could raise the dead. If it was His will, He could have raised my mother.
I told them to take the machines off. If it was God’s will for her to live, the machine 
wouldn’t stop it. The Lord’s will came to pass, and He took her to heaven. Shortly 
after, we buried her, and God gave me grace to forgive and forget. I told her 
husband I wasn’t crazy—I knew he did it—but I shook his hand and forgave him by 
God’s grace.
You might ask how I know he killed my mother. My wife’s aunt was married to his 
son. When my wife asked her aunt what happened, she said, "I can’t tell you 
because they will kill me too." He had been accused of more than one murder and 
never charged. The Bible says God directs government officials (Romans 13:1) and 
that vengeance is the Lord’s. I would rather he be transformed and serve Christ—
like Saul, who persecuted Christians but turned to Jesus and became Paul the 
apostle (Acts 9). Whatever God has planned for him, I pray for mercy on his soul.
God gave me strength to get through the test. If you remember my testimony, I 
was very angry. I fought anyone who gave me attitude. I beat my wife and even 
threw my father through a wall. But in Christ, the old is gone and the new has 

come (2 Corinthians 5:17). If God got me through that test, He can get you through 
yours.
I believe God used that time to purify me from rage and anger. The enemy still 
tries to attack me with anger sometimes, but I give it to the Sanctifier, who purifies 
me more and more through tests of fire.
God also turned that test into a testimony. I wrote a book about it—How God 
Moves—about how God moved during that trial. The book ended up in the hands 
of a young girl whose mother was also murdered. She held unforgiveness toward 
the killer, was upset at God, and had stopped going to church. Someone from a 
church where I used to do outreach in Indianapolis gave her the book. She read it, 
and praise God, she returned to church.
Some say, "I don’t want to become a Christian because I’ll be broke." That’s a lie 
from Satan. If He does pull your wealth, it’s either because you made money your 
god or because He wants you to show you will serve Him no matter what, like Job
—and like Job, if you remain faithful, you’ll be blessed double. Others say, "I’ll go 
through too much." God allows trials, but they are for our good. I’d rather go 
through hard things with God than without Him. God allowed me to go through a 
lot because otherwise I couldn’t minister and connect with people in their pain. 
You can’t give what you don’t have. Get through the tests, and God will tur n your 
test into a testimony—there’s glory in the stories of God’s people.
I’ll close with this: I recently learned my mother had a dream in August 2003. In it, 
she stood in a huge room full of stained glass with a bright light she couldn’t look 
at shining through—she said the light looked like silver. She saw many people 
rushing to an open wooden doorway with no door, people from all nations. She 
rushed to go through too, but a woman at a desk stopped her: "Where are you 
going?" "Through the door," my mother said. The woman opened a huge book, 
searched the pages, and said, "Your name’s not in the book." My mother asked, 
"Why does my name need to be in the book to go through the doorway?" The 
woman replied, "You have two years to turn Christian; then your name will be in 
this book and you can go through the doorway." Then my mother woke up.
Two years later, in August 2005, my mother died. Praise God, she made heaven.
Why mention the dream? She saw the light—God, a consuming fire. Why did the 
light look silver? I studied this. Our fires shine orange, blue, and purple because of 
impurities. But a fire without impurities shines bright white—like silver. Each test of 
fire you pass purifies you. The more purified you are, the more you shine like 
Jesus.
As John Maxwell said, "Don’t allow the fire of adversity to make you a skeptic. 
Allow it to purify you."
