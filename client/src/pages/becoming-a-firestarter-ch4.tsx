                <Paragraph>
                  When you hear the names King David, King Solomon, and Samson, what comes to 
                  mind? Mighty men of God, famous men of God, good-looking men of God? All of 
                  that is true. But they share one more thing in common: <strong>they all fell to the lust of 
                  the eyes.</strong>
                </Paragraph>

                <Paragraph>
                  King David was known as a shepherd, an armor-bearer, a poet, a prophet, the 
                  ultimate king, a warrior, and a man after God's own heart. King Solomon was 
                  known as the wisest, richest, most famous king; he built the temple of the Lord 
                  and saw fire come down from heaven. He saw God twice in visions and was so 
                  loved by the Lord that God gave him another name‚ÄîJedidiah‚Äîwhich means 
                  "beloved of Jehovah." Then there was Samson, one of Israel's most famous 
                  judges, the strongest man who ever lived. What happened to these mighty men 
                  beloved by God?
                </Paragraph>

                <Paragraph>
                  King David fell for Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11:3). King Solomon fell for hundreds of 
                  pagan women whom God strictly forbade‚Äîhe had 1,000 women altogether, 
                  including wives and concubines‚Äîand he even burned incense to his wives' false 
                  gods (1 Kings 11:7‚Äì9). Samson fell for Delilah and other pagan women (Judges 
                  16:6).

                  Remember from the previous chapter that the fuel for the fire is the Word. Every 
                  one of these men heard the voice of God and knew the Word of God. King David 
                  said, "I have hidden thy Word in my heart that I might not sin against you" (Psalm 
                  119). The point is, <strong>they stopped looking to the Word for help; they didn't look to 
                  the Word for strength; they stopped obeying the Word of the Lord.</strong> And they all 
                  paid the consequences for their sin.

                    stayed home and saw Bathsheba taking a bath (2 Samuel 11). That sin gave birth 
                    to more sin. He had Bathsheba's husband Uriah killed to cover up his sin of a love

                  <Paragraph>
                    Here's the takeaway: when your eyes are on God‚ÄîGod is good (Mark 10), and 
                    Jesus is the Light (John 8:12)‚Äîyour whole life will be consumed with God's 
                    presence, and the fire of God will be evident in your life for all to see, like a 
                    floodlight. Floodlights come on during storms and blackouts‚Äîduring darkness. 
                    You will be used to help people come out of the darkness of the world and to 
                    encourage those going through trials when you keep your eyes on the fire and 
                    don't hide anything from God‚Äîno dark corners‚Äîand allow Him to move in every 
                    area of your life.

                  <Paragraph>
                    Just make sure the light (fire) you think you have is not actually darkness. What do 
                    light and darkness have in common? Nothing.
