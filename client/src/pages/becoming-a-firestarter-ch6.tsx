              <Paragraph>
                I want to spend this chapter on the importance of prayer. Jesus said, "Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing." (John 15:4‚Äì5) The psalmist adds, "But it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, that I may tell of all thy works." (Psalm 73:28) These verses show we must draw near‚Äîand stay near‚Äîto our Savior. Only then will our lives have lasting significance.
              </Paragraph>
              
              <Paragraph>
                Because God is a consuming fire, the more we abide in Him and draw near to Him, the more our lives will be set on fire and our character will become like Christ. One meaning of consume is to waste away or be exhausted. <strong>As we remain in His presence, the old nature slowly wastes away, and we become new in Christ.</strong>

And the glory of Jehovah abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights."

                  The Hebrew word for devouring here is <em>'akal</em>‚Äî"to eat, devour, burn up, consume." Like Moses, when we spend time with God, we are consumed by His fire and learn to hear His voice clearly so we can minister properly.

                In 2007 I toured Israel, with a day in Athens. I stood on Mars Hill (Acts 17), visited Bethlehem, Nazareth, and the Sea of Galilee where Jesus walked on water, called His disciples, and delivered the demoniac. We worshiped at the Garden Tomb and I was baptized in the Jordan River. I even stood on the Mount of Olives‚ÄîJesus' favorite place to pray.

                It was when I first got serious about Christ‚Äîwhen I shut down my crooked businesses, let go of the nice cars, and stopped scamming. I went broke. One day, oppressed and hopeless, with no money for the mortgage and no plan, I went into my office, shut the door, dropped to my knees, and cried, "God, please help me." As I lifted my hands, it felt like a thousand pounds lifted off my chest. I stayed there about seven hours‚Äîreading the Word, worshiping, and soaking in His presence‚Äîwhen a fragrance filled the room, like roses and cedar.

Jesus called hell Gehenna‚Äîthe garbage dump of His day.

                Consider this: the earth's circumference is about 25,000 miles; the speed of light is about 186,282 miles per second. God is light, and His angels are often accompanied by light. When the church prayed for Peter, an angel appeared and "a light shone in the cell" (Acts 12:7). When Elisha prayed for his servant, "The Lord opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha." (2 Kings 6:17)
