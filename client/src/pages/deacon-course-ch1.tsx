            <div className="bg-purple-50 border-l-4 border-purple-500 p-6 mb-6">
              <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-purple-900 mb-3">1. The Greek Definition: More Than a Helper</h4>
              <p className="mb-3">The English word "Deacon" comes directly from the Greek word:</p>
              <p className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-900 text-center mb-3">ŒîŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒøœÇ (pronounced: dee-ah-kon-os)</p>
              <p className="mb-3">While this word is often translated simply as "servant" or "minister," its root meaning is far more powerful and specific.</p>
              <p className="mb-3">It doesn't just refer to a general helper (that would be the Greek word <em>doulos</em>). Instead, <strong>ŒîŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒøœÇ</strong> implies:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-3">
                <li>A trusted attendant</li>
                <li>A designated messenger</li>
                <li>One who executes the commands of another</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In ancient times, a diakonos was not a lowly slave but a respected intermediary who acted with the authority of the person they served. They were a conduit of will and provision.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-6">
              <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-blue-900 mb-3">2. The Spiritual Definition: Identity in Action</h4>
              <p className="mb-3">Spiritually, this transforms the role from a task into a sacred trust.</p>
              <p className="font-bold text-blue-900 mb-2">A Deacon is:</p>
              
              <div className="space-y-3">
                <div>
                  <p className="font-semibold text-blue-900">Heaven's Distributor:</p>
                  <p className="text-blue-800">They are entrusted to distribute God's grace, mercy, and practical provision to the body of Christ. They are the hands that deliver God's goodness.</p>

                  <p className="text-blue-800">Jesus defined His own mission through this word: <em>"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve [diakonƒìsai]"</em> (Mark 10:45). When you serve as a deacon, you are quite literally enacting the ministry of Jesus on earth.</p>

                <div>
                  <p className="font-semibold text-blue-900">A Catalyst for Unity:</p>
                  <p className="text-blue-800">When the first deacons were appointed in Acts 6, their service (diakonia) solved a crisis of neglect and allowed the Word of God to spread "and the number of disciples multiplied greatly" (Acts 6:7). Their practical service unlocked spiritual multiplication.</p>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-green-900 mb-3">3. The Concise Definition:</h4>
              <p className="text-green-900">A Deacon is a <strong>Spirit-appointed, servant-hearted leader ü§≤ who is trusted with executing the practical ministry of the church</strong>, acting as a conduit of God's love and provision to His people, thereby freeing the church to worship in unity and advancing the Gospel through tangible acts of service.</p>
              <p className="text-center font-bold text-xl text-green-900 mt-4">In a nutshell: Your service is your ministry. Your ministry is your message. ‚ú®</p>
            </div>

            <p className="mb-6">This is the weight and the wonder of the calling. It is a high and holy charge. Now, with this understanding cemented in our hearts, we are ready to explore what this looks like in practice.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">This course wasn't written from a place of theory‚Äîit was written from the fire of experience. üôå I've walked the path you're now considering, and it's my passion to help you walk it boldly and effectively.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">Birthed out of the vision of <strong>SFGM Boston | The House of Restoration Ministries (HRM)</strong>, this journey is built on three pillars:</p>

            <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-4 mb-6">
              <ul className="list-none space-y-2">

                <li className="text-yellow-900">‚úÖ <strong>Tangible grace</strong></li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p className="mb-4">This isn't about joining a committee. This is a sacred summons to step into a higher level of commitment within the body of Christ. It's about your character being refined in the fires of obedience üî• long before any title is ever placed on you.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">I've been through the battles‚Äîthe spiritual attacks, the setbacks, the breakthroughs. And I've learned this: God's call is irrevocable, and His grace is more than enough for every step‚Äîand every stumble.</p>

            <p className="mb-6">My prayer is that this course doesn't just inform you‚Äîit activates you. May it stir up the gift inside you üïäÔ∏è, equip you for real ministry, and remind you that you're not alone. We're in this together.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">Let me keep it real with you.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">Long before I was a pastor, I felt that Holy Spirit nudge. I didn't wait for a title‚ÄîI just started SERVING. Setting up chairs, helping families, doing whatever was needed. I learned that the anointing to serve is a real and powerful gift.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">But my journey wasn't all smooth. I hit a rough season. Took a wrong turn. Stepped away from church. For a while, I thought I'd lost my chance‚Äîand my calling.</p>

            <div className="bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-500 p-4 mb-6">
              <p className="text-orange-900 font-bold text-lg">But even in that wilderness, I found out something undeniable:</p>
              <p className="text-orange-900 italic text-xl mt-2">God's gifts and His call can never be withdrawn. (Romans 11:29 NLT)</p>
            </div>

            <p className="mb-4">Even when I wasn't in church, I was still helping people. Still praying for people. I was a deacon in the desert‚Äîand God never let go of me.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">My comeback wasn't based on my performance‚Äîbut on God's mercy and faithfulness. When I returned, I got back into serving. I was ordained as a deacon. Then God promoted me to elder. And eventually, to pastor.</p>
