I want to talk about going through what people sometimes refer to as a <span className="text-red-300 font-semibold">"hell experience."</span> This goes beyond an unnecessary storm; this is where you're drowning from the storm and all hell is breaking loose around you and it causes you to cry out to God like never before.

For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head. I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O Lord my God." Jonah 2:1-6 KJV</p>

Maybe the loss of a loved one to cause them to draw closer to God to experience true life in Christ.

Why would a loving God want to do that to His people? <span className="text-green-300 font-semibold">To give them a wake up call here on earth so they wont have to face true hell for all eternity!</span> The next verse says, essentially, "If my people call upon me, then I will hear, heal and restore!"</p>

                <p>This is what Jonah did; he cried out to the Lord because of "his affliction," not because he felt like it. However, he had to experience that which he referred to as hell. The original Hebrew definition is Sheol, defined as follows: sheol, underworld, grave, hell, hades, or the world of the dead. It is a pit, a place without praise, a place where the wicked are sent, a devastating storm.</p>

So think about this; he just went through a storm, and now he gets swallowed by a great fish. Many people believe it was a whale. It's hot and smelly, and acid is burning your skin, while water keeps coming in and out of the stomach of the fish and each time you almost drown. He's tired, weary, exhausted, can't fight off sleep any longer, and the pressure of being deep down in the depths of the sea is now making him delirious. He begins to realize if he dies, not only is he going through a hell of an experience, but he just might enter into hell if he dies.

God wants us to serve Him in the way He wants, not how we want. We cannot pick and choose the things we want to obey and then say no to the things we don't want to do. Jonah learned that the hard way, and so do the people that are not willing to obey the Lord in whatever He has chosen for them to do. <span className="text-blue-300 font-semibold">We need to say whatever He has called us to say and go wherever He has called us to go!</span></p>

                <p>Mercy is stopping the punishment we deserve because of what we all have done. We did deserve death, hell, and the grave. We did deserve the lashes on our backs and the cross that Jesus took for us.

                <p>Let's learn a lesson from this chapter of Jonah's life, that things that hold us from God like the fish held Jonah will not let us go until we let our rebellious attitude go. Decide today to let it go and you'll see how it will allow a release in your life and freedom to serve the Lord like never before so you can get back to what you vowed.</p>
                
                <p>To serve the Lord because He first served us. Think about it today, do you want to go through a breaking in such a way you feel like all hell is breaking out around you and your house? Of course not, so let's have an attitude that says: <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold text-xl">hell? no, I'm letting go!</span></p>
