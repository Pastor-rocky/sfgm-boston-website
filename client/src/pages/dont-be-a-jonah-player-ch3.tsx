But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them.

                  <p className="font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-2">üíî My Story:</p>
                  <p>Before I accepted the call that God placed on my life I was very rebellious and disobedient. I went to church, worshipped God, gave in the offering, and even told people about how good God was; however, secretly I was fighting depression because no matter what I accomplished and what I tried to do to be happy, it didn't work.</p>
                  
                  <p className="mt-3">It's because I had religion but not a true relationship with God. I wasn't willing to obey God and repent of my sinful and rebellious lifestyle. The depression got so bad that <strong className="text-red-300">twice I tried committing suicide.</strong></p>
                </div>
                
                <div className="bg-blue-900/20 p-4 rounded border border-blue-400/30 mb-4">
                  <p className="font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-2">üíä The Final Attempt:</p>
                  <p>The last time I tried I took a whole bottle of pills and fell asleep, but an hour later I got up out of my sleep throwing up. My cousin that was in the house called my uncle, and when he saw me he knew there was something wrong. I wouldn't tell them what I did, and at this point I was delusional and talking crazy.</p>
                  
                  <p className="mt-3">So they forced me in a car, drove me to the emergency room, and the doctors found out what I had done and immediately began the process to help me. Three days later a doctor came in and told me <strong className="text-blue-300">if the pills would have been in my system for another hour or so I would have been dead!</strong></p>
                </div>
                
                <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-center text-green-300 mb-4">I thank God because he allowed me to live and not die so I can warn people about not running from their calling and start serving God so they can receive the fullness of joy and help others do the same.</p>

                  <p className="font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-2">üí° Warning Signs:</p>
                  <p>I also have personal friends that have committed suicide. The sad part is I never knew they were dealing with suicidal thoughts. I never knew they were being attacked with depression. If I had known then what I know now, I would have known how to help them. <strong className="text-yellow-300">The biggest sign of a person that's dealing with depression is a person running from serving God!</strong></p>

                <p>Maybe you're not dealing with the spirit of heaviness but maybe you know someone who isn't willing to serve God and obey the calling that God has placed on their life. Allow them to read this chapter. After you're done reading this book, give it to a person that needs a word of hope in the midst of their depression‚Äîyou never know, you might just save a life!</p>
                
                <p>God comforts the depressed and He also uses people to help others who are depressed. Titus, a companion of Paul the apostle, was used to encourage Paul and others by just being there for them:</p>
                
                <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-green-400 pl-4 mt-4 italic text-gray-200">
                  <p>"For even when we arrived in Macedonia our bodies had no rest, but we were oppressed at every turn--conflicts and disputes without, fears and dread within. But God, who comforts and encourages the depressed and the disquieted, comforted us by the arrival of Titus."</p>
