                <strong>What is a fire starter?</strong> A fire starter is a person that's on fire for God and helps

              <Paragraph>
                <strong>What does it mean to be on fire for God?</strong> It means to be totally consumed by God's 
                presence in your life, where it's all about Him and nothing else matters except 
                pleasing God through your words and deeds and helping others do the same.

              <Paragraph>
                For fifteen years of my life I attended church off and on. At church I would go 
                through the motions and even sing in the choir; however, outside of church I was a 
                completely different person. I physically abused my wife, I cheated on her, I 
                treated my kids horribly, I had five crooked businesses, and I was filled with pride 
                and anger. I was violent, fighting anyone who even gave me a hint of attitude‚Äì‚Äì
                once I pushed my own father through a wall. I was a scammer, a liar, a thief, and an 
                adulterous person who used to party several times a week, getting drunk out of my 
                mind. My wife was a fortune teller and I often conspired with her to con her 
                customers.
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>
                The worst part of all this is I thought I was a Christian because I used to go to 
                church and put a little money in the offering. I used to look at people in church and 
                say to myself, "man I want what they have"; I didn't understand it‚Äì‚ÄìI went to 
                church, I believed in Jesus, but why wasn't I excited like they were, why couldn't I 
                get involved in the worship like they did, why didn't I have the zeal they had, why 
                am I not on fire for God like them?

              <Paragraph>
                I really thought I was a Christian so I should have had what they had. One day, in 
                October of 2004, I started to realize why I didn't have what they had. My mother 
                in-law came in town and she said to me "Anthony you can go to church, you can 
                pray, you can fast, and you can sing in the choir but if you are not in the Word of 
                God it is all meaningless."

              <Paragraph>
                Then she gave me a Bible book store address and told me to go and buy a bible, 
                so I listened and respected what she said because she was a person that 
                preached Christianity with her mouth shut. What do I mean by saying that? She 
                lived Christianity‚Äì‚Äìnot just talked about it. I used to treat her daughter horribly but 
                she never argued with me, she never said anything negative to me, the only thing 
                she did was pray for me. So that day I went and bought my first Bible, a New Living 
                Translation. It was a Bible that can be read through in a year and it was an easy to 
                understand Bible.
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>
                That day I started reading. I started in the Gospel of John, and in a few days I 
                realized that I really wasn't a Christian and if I was to die I would have gone to Hell 
                (Galatians 5:19). I also realized God's grace and love for my life and for the world 
                (John 3:16). I also realized why I wasn't like the other people in the church who 
                appeared to be passionately on fire for God; it was because of my sinful lifestyle 
                and my unwillingness to obey His Word.

                  full-blown ministry with the Church of God. The Church of God denomination has 
                  given us a building; the building they gave us is the church I grew up in. I am now

                accept it. You cannot live a life of disobedience like I was living prior to my born 
                again experience and expect God to answer your prayers, bless you and set you on 
                fire. The Bible says when you live in disobedience you fall in to the curse of the 
                world. (Deuteronomy 28:15-20). You might say Jesus took all the curses of the 
                world and the curse of sin; He did (see Galatians 3:13), but if you are not abiding in 
                Jesus, living for Him, and obeying Him, you disqualify yourself from this (John 15) 
                and you, like Cain, open the door to Satan (Genesis 4:7) and allow him to destroy 
                you. You end up living a cursed, miserable, angry life because of disobedience to 
                God.

                  If you were to bring a sacrifice back then to the temple the priest would take the 
                  animal and usually cut the neck, meaning the animal is not coming back. So to 
                  present yourself as a living sacrifice means to constantly die to self on an every 
                  day level‚Äì‚Äìit means to constantly crucify the flesh and not give in to the lust of the 
                  flesh, lust of the eye and the pride of life (1 John 2:16-17).

                When you want to live a life like that then you will know the will of God and then 
                you will be pleasing to Him and then God will accept your offering which is your

              <Paragraph>
                What does the story have to do with fire? Well, when you would bring a sacrifice to 
                the priests they would put it on the altar and burn it. Before the tabernacle or the 
                temple was built and established God would accept people's offerings by sending 
                fire from heaven to consume it. Some theologians and scholars believe the reason 
                Cain knew God didn't accept His offering is because God didn't send fire from 
                heaven to consume it. They believe God sent fire from heaven to consume Abel's 
                offering and that is how Cain knew God did not accept his offering.

                Jesus said something that really amazed me. First He begins in Luke 12 talking 
                about whom people should fear‚Äì‚Äìnot man but God, who has the authority to throw 
                you in Hell. Then He starts talking about a man that made his life all about his 
                possessions and he didn't acknowledge God, and how God required his soul from 
                him one night and he was not ready for God. Then Jesus explains not to worry 
                about things of the world but please God and He will add to your life. He continues 
                and says how if He comes back and faithful servants are serving Him they will be 
                rewarded but if He comes back and the servants are not faithful they will be 
                punished then He says this:

                then a faithful servant that gets rewarded; a servant that stops being faithful and

                God</strong>. So we don't have a choice of being cold because people that confess Jesus 
                are believers and believers in Jesus can either be hot, on fire, or lukewarm, 
                claiming Christ but living like a nonbeliever!

                In the text of Revelation three, Jesus says because you are lukewarm I will spit you 
                out of my mouth! Back then in the days of the Laodicean church they had a water 
                problem in the city so they had to build an aqueduct (like a bridge/piping system) 
                to bring in the water from a city six miles away. The water used to enter into the 
                aqueduct ice cold, but by the time it traveled six miles to enter Laodicea the 
                desert sun had been beaming on it so by the time it came out of the aqueduct it 
                was lukewarm!
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>
                So Jesus was basically illustrating that <strong>the same way the lukewarm water is 
                disgusting to you is the same way your lifestyle is disgusting to me!</strong> So if Jesus 
                spits us out of His mouth it means to cast us out of His presence.

              <Paragraph>
                I was in the east coast in May of 2011 on a six day crusade, and on one of those 
                days I was scheduled to preach in Washington, D.C., for a pastor friend of mine, 
                Pastor Frank. I was actually going to preach a sermon on how to get on fire for 
                God, and on the way there my van ran out of gas. I was so frustrated; we were only 
                blocks from the church when it ran out of gas. The church service had to start 
                without us, we were 30 minutes late. I was upset at one of my guys that was on the 
                trip with me because he was driving and he didn't pay attention to the gas gauge.

                  I start walking in frustration, and then God ministered to me and said, <strong>"I'm going to 
                  use this in the sermon tonight so calm down."</strong> So I did; we got some gas and went 
                  to church and the fire of God fell on that place like I haven't seen in a long time!

              <Paragraph>
                The point God gave me about the gas is this: <strong>to have fire you need fuel.</strong> You're 
                responsible to make sure you have the fuel. No one else is to blame, you have to 
                constantly watch your spiritual gauge and can never allow yourself to run out 
                because you might be close to where God wants you, but it's not about being 
                close it's about being right on for the glory of God!

                can stretch the gas longer than it can go. We will not be perfect in this life with 
                God, but God sure does want us to try. The word <em>perfect</em> in the Greek means 
                "mature"; it is time to grow up and put gas in the car and make sure it never gets 
                low.

                Sometimes you see people and they look like they are on fire for God but then the 
                fire dies down. Why is this? The answer is found in In Luke chapter eight. Jesus 
                gave an illustration about a man that sowed some seed on four different types of 
                ground, then later He explained the story to the disciples more clearly.

                    their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. They on the rock are they, 
                    which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which 
                    for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. And that which fell among 
                    thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares

                people out of bondage and slavery. The way God did it is what amazes me.

                You might say I don't understand the Bible, what's the use? Let me tell you a story that 
                I found on the Internet one day; this is exactly how I read it:

                  There was an old man that lived in the mountains of eastern Kentucky. The old 
                  man had a big family. One day one of the old man's grandsons approached him 
                  with a problem. The Grandson said, "Pap, I read the Bible and I don't understand 
                  it, and what I understand I forget as soon as I close the Bible covers. What's the 
                  use of reading the Bible!"

                  The Grandfather ordered the grandson to get the basket 
                  they used to carry the heating coal into the house and run down to the river and 
                  bring back a basket of water to the house. To please his grandfather, the lad 
                  grabbed the basket, ran to the river and got a basket of water. The lad ran back to 
                  the house with the water. By the time the lad reached the house the basket was 
                  empty.

                  The grandfather chided the young boy, "Hurry and go bring me a basket of water. 
                  DO IT NOW!" The lad ran quickly from the river. The basket was full when he left 
                  the river, but by the time he arrived at the house the basket of water was dry. After 
                  his third trip, the boy told his granddad, "It is no use, I cannot retain the water in 
                  the basket until I get here. It is useless."

                When you hear the names King David, King Solomon, and Samson, what comes to 
                mind? Mighty men of God, famous men of God, good-looking men of God? All of

                the eyes.</strong>
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>
                King David was known as a shepherd, an armor-bearer, a poet, a prophet, the 
                ultimate king, a warrior, and a man after God's own heart. King Solomon was 
                known as the wisest, richest, most famous king; he built the temple of the Lord 
                and saw fire come down from heaven. He saw God twice in visions and was so 
                loved by the Lord that God gave him another name‚ÄîJedidiah‚Äîwhich means 
                "beloved of Jehovah." Then there was Samson, one of Israel's most famous 
                judges, the strongest man who ever lived. What happened to these mighty men 
                beloved by God?
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>
                King David fell for Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11:3). King Solomon fell for hundreds of 
                pagan women whom God strictly forbade‚Äîhe had 1,000 women altogether, 
                including wives and concubines‚Äîand he even burned incense to his wives' false 
                gods (1 Kings 11:7‚Äì9). Samson fell for Delilah and other pagan women (Judges 
                16:6).

                said, "I have hidden thy Word in my heart that I might not sin against you" (Psalm 
                119). The point is, <strong>they stopped looking to the Word for help; they didn't look to 
                the Word for strength; they stopped obeying the Word of the Lord.</strong> And they all 
                paid the consequences for their sin.

                    The lamb was like a daughter to him.

                  stayed home and saw Bathsheba taking a bath (2 Samuel 11). That sin gave birth 
                  to more sin. He had Bathsheba's husband Uriah killed to cover up his sin of a love 
                  child and to take Bathsheba as his wife.

Why must a person be tested? <strong>So our witness shines.</strong> As Peter says, just as gold is tested by fire to purify it, our lives before God must be purified. The more fire, the more purity is revealed‚Äîin the gold and in us. The result is integrity, virtue, faith, and holiness. God wants you to be the real deal.

              <Paragraph>
                There was a group of women in a Bible study on Malachi. As they studied chapter 3, they came across verse 3: "He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver." The statement puzzled them. One woman offered to find out more about refining silver and report back.
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>
                She visited a silversmith and watched him at work. Without explaining her reason, she observed as he held a piece of silver over the fire, letting it heat up. He explained that to refine silver, he must hold it in the middle of the fire where the flames are hottest to burn away all impurities.
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>
                She thought about God holding us in such a hot spot‚Äîand then about the verse that says He sits as a refiner. She asked if he really had to sit the entire time the silver was in the fire. "Yes," he said. He not only had to sit and hold the silver, but he had to keep his eyes on it the whole time. If left even a moment too long, the silver would be destroyed.
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>
                She asked, "How do you know when the silver is fully refined?" He smiled: <strong>"Oh, that's easy‚Äîwhen I see my image in it."</strong>

                I want to spend this chapter on the importance of prayer. Jesus said, "Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing." (John 15:4‚Äì5) The psalmist adds, "But it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, that I may tell of all thy works." (Psalm 73:28) These verses show we must draw near‚Äîand stay near‚Äîto our Savior. Only then will our lives have lasting significance.

              <Paragraph>
                Because God is a consuming fire, the more we abide in Him and draw near to Him, the more our lives will be set on fire and our character will become like Christ. One meaning of consume is to waste away or be exhausted. <strong>As we remain in His presence, the old nature slowly wastes away, and we become new in Christ.</strong>

                Consider this: the earth's circumference is about 25,000 miles; the speed of light is about 186,282 miles per second. God is light, and His angels are often accompanied by light. When the church prayed for Peter, an angel appeared and "a light shone in the cell" (Acts 12:7). When Elisha prayed for his servant, "The Lord opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha." (2 Kings 6:17)

                Consider this story (paraphrased from Christian Biography Resources): D. L. Moody, at 18, was a shoe clerk in Boston. His Sunday school teacher, Edward Kimball, prayed and went to the store to speak with him. Nervous about interrupting business, Kimball nearly passed by, but turned back, went in, and briefly told Moody of Christ's love. Moody was ready; he yielded to Christ there in the stockroom. Forty years later, Moody described the joy that flooded his life that day.

He hid in a friend's room for hours, overwhelmed with God's presence, until he cried out for God to stay His hand. <strong>He rose in the power of the Spirit, and the fire marked his life.</strong>
