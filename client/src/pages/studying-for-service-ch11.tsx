                I can tell you that I've been a Christian for 18 years of my life but I've truly been a Christian for seven years. Why would I say that? Well, I was baptized and said the sinner's prayer many times but I was living a life that totally contradicted the Bible, like adultery, lust, drugs, drinking, gambling, scamming, stealing, lying, pride, anger, bitterness, and hate.
              </p>

                If I died in that unrepentant sin I would have gone straight to hell (Galatians 5:19) even though I was in church every other Sunday and claiming Christianity‚Äîit didn't matter because God called us to be imitators not impersonators! And I was definitely not an imitator of Jesus.

            <p className="mb-6">
              But something happened in 2004 when my mother-in-law came in town for a visit. Really I believe it was by divine appointment because she told me something that day that forever changed my life. She said, "Anthony, you can go to church, you can pray and you can fast and you can sing in choir but if you're not in the Word of God it's all for no reason." It impacted me because she was a woman of God that showed it in action. I always said she preached Christianity with her mouth shut! Why do I say that? Because I used to cheat on her daughter and physically abuse her by beating her up and my mother-in-law never said not one negative word to me‚Äîshe would only pray for me.

                So I listened to her that day and she gave me the address to a Bible bookstore next to my house. That day I bought my first Bible. It was on October 28, 2004. It was a New Living Translation Bible. I started reading the Bible that day. I started in the book of John and my life was never the same after that.

              A couple months later God told me through prayer one day to read Joshua 1:8. I didn't know that Scripture really because I was still reading in the New Testament, so I went and checked the Scripture out. That day God also told me to start doing Bible studies. I received confirmation the following week at a church I used to visit other than my home church from Pastor Walter Johns. He was preaching on Joshua 1:8. Praise God I started the Bible studies in the basement of my house with about 15 guys. A year later I finished my first Bible cover to cover. It delivered me from all the previous sins I listed above‚ÄîI was set free and born again (1 Peter 1:23). And in May, 2007, I became a pastor in Chicago, IL, with Soldiers for God Ministry. It went from 15 to 150 in three years.

              Every successful and faithful man was a man of the Word of God. If you're not a man that reads the Word on a daily basis you will never receive the fullness of what God has for you and your ministry. Paul the apostle said to Timothy, "When you come, be sure to bring the coat I left with Carpus at Troas. Also bring my books, and especially my papers" (2 Timothy 4:13 NLT). This was a man that ministered as soon as he was converted and now he was about to die. What was he worried about? His papers, his books, the Word of God! We can never say we know enough of God's Word; we should read His Word not just to find something to preach on but to learn how to practice what we preach and to teach others to do the same. Also, so we can have a word always to give to God's people.

              The table of shewbread was referred to as the table of the Presence. God's light forever shines on His people. The 12 baked cakes of bread spoke of God's people who were one with Him as the priests joined together for the fellowship of eating the bread and becoming one. Jesus referred to Himself as the bread of life and said if we eat this bread we will live forever. The very nature of bread is to provide physical sustenance and as you eat the bread and digest it, it becomes part of you. The very nature of the Word of God is to provide spiritual sustenance and as it is received it becomes part of our very nature. Just as the table always speaks of fellowship and communion, so the table of the shewbread points to Jesus who has made a covenant built on better promises and provided a blood covenant meal for us to partake that we might all be one in the Spirit.

            </h3>

            <p className="mb-6">
              In August of 2011 there was a pastor's meeting for all Power Ministry ministers. It was held in Chicago at the church I pastor. In this meeting we discussed the importance of the Word of God and we soon discovered that a lot of the ministers were not reading their Bibles on a daily basis, they were only reading to get a message to preach. So we resolved to make a covenant to read the Bible on a daily basis. The way we planned to do this is at least three to four chapters a day. The reason why we planned it this way is because if you read three chapters a day and four on Sunday you will read the entire Bible in a year. It's been seven months since the meeting and the following testimonies are from a few of the pastors that were at the pastor's meeting.

We were amazed to find out that most of the ministers were not spending daily time in the word of God. I found that even I was only studying for sermons only and not on a daily basis. Thank God that revival turned my life upside down and since then I have been reading 3‚Äì4 chapters per day, I started in the book of Genesis and as we speak I am in the book of Psalms, if you are not on a daily devotional I recommend that you would begin one. If it changed my life it will change yours too."
