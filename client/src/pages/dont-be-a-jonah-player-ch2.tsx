                <p>I read a book called "The Bait of Satan" by John Bevere. In this book the author explains the dangers of being offended and allowing the enemy to instill bitterness in a person's heart. The word for "offense" found in Matthew 24:10 is the greek word skandalon. It is where we get our English word for scandal. The word skandalon was also the name of a lever that sets off a trap and catches the victim in its claws because they fell for the bait that was connected to the lever.</p>

                <p>Whatever it is that offended you it then becomes a scandal! You start complaining about it and telling others how you were done wrong.

                  <p>About two years before I answered the call to become a minister, one of the hardest things in my life happened to me. That was the enemy's way to try to make me become offended at God, angry at a person, and bitter because of what happened.</p>

                  <p className="mt-3">He was a cruel, evil man that had accusations against him of murdering others in the past before he ever murdered my mother. I tried to tell my mother not to marry him and I even tried to tell her to leave him weeks before she was murdered by him, but she wouldn't listen.</p>

                  <p>One day I got a phone call that she was on life support from a head injury. I took the next flight out from Chicago to New York. When I finally got to the hospital, I thought I was going to fight with this man that did this to my mother.</p>
                  
                  <p className="mt-3">I entered the hospital room and I saw my mother, who was only forty-one years old at the time, filled with hoses and connected to machines. There were scars on her arms and neck from what looked like a fight she was in from a few weeks before when I spoke to her about leaving him.</p>

                  <p className="mt-3">I began to tell him about Jesus and how only Jesus could help my mother, because he told me he prays to a saint called Guadalupe. I told him how Jesus was the one true God.</p>

                <p>The day I had to sign the papers to pull the plug on the life support that was keeping my mother in a comatose state, I was in the room with my mother and he walked in.

God told me, <em>"I'm going to use you to display my love through your forgiveness and obedience."</em></p>
                  
                  <p className="mt-3">I shook my head in amazement; I then walked out of the room, went up to him, and said I'm sorry!</p>
