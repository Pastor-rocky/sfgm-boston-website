                There was a group of women in a Bible study on Malachi. As they studied chapter 3, they came across verse 3: "He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver." The statement puzzled them. One woman offered to find out more about refining silver and report back.

              <Paragraph>
                She visited a silversmith and watched him at work. Without explaining her reason, she observed as he held a piece of silver over the fire, letting it heat up. He explained that to refine silver, he must hold it in the middle of the fire where the flames are hottest to burn away all impurities.
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>
                She thought about God holding us in such a hot spot‚Äîand then about the verse that says He sits as a refiner. She asked if he really had to sit the entire time the silver was in the fire. "Yes," he said. He not only had to sit and hold the silver, but he had to keep his eyes on it the whole time. If left even a moment too long, the silver would be destroyed.
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>
                She asked, "How do you know when the silver is fully refined?" He smiled: <strong>"Oh, that's easy‚Äîwhen I see my image in it."</strong>

The enemy won't touch you because you submitted to God through testing by fire. You will go through the fire without being burned. And like the refiner's fire, people will see Jesus in you. The people saw a visitation of Jesus in the middle of the fire, protecting them with His holy fire.

              <Paragraph>
                Here is the biggest test I've gone through. In August 2005, I received a call that my mother was brain-dead in the hospital, and people said her husband did it. I flew to New York. I saw my mother full of tubes, with cuts and scrapes on her arms and neck. I remembered two weeks earlier she told me, "Anthony, this man is going to kill me; he put a knife to my throat and cut me." I was looking at those scars. She had asked me for money, and I had said no because I was upset she stayed with him, even though I warned her.

              <Paragraph>
                I prayed and fasted for days, asking God for strength not to lose it, because her husband was at the hospital the whole time. One day he came into the room. I stood up, and God put such peace on me. He talked about praying to some saint, and I told him the only way to the Father is Jesus. As days passed, God worked on me. One day, reading Jeremiah‚Äî"vengeance is the Lord's"‚ÄîI knew what God wanted me to do.

              <Paragraph>
                Days later my family decided to remove life support. God gave me peace about it. The doctors said there was no way she would recover, even though I knew God could raise the dead. If it was His will, He could have raised my mother.

              <Paragraph>
                I told them to take the machines off. If it was God's will for her to live, the machine wouldn't stop it. The Lord's will came to pass, and He took her to heaven. Shortly after, we buried her, and God gave me grace to forgive and forget. I told her husband I wasn't crazy‚ÄîI knew he did it‚Äîbut I shook his hand and forgave him by God's grace.
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>
                You might ask how I know he killed my mother. My wife's aunt was married to his son. When my wife asked her aunt what happened, she said, "I can't tell you because they will kill me too." He had been accused of more than one murder and never charged. The Bible says God directs government officials (Romans 13:1) and that vengeance is the Lord's. I would rather he be transformed and serve Christ‚Äîlike Saul, who persecuted Christians but turned to Jesus and became Paul the apostle (Acts 9). Whatever God has planned for him, I pray for mercy on his soul.

                I'll close with this: I recently learned my mother had a dream in August 2003. In it, she stood in a huge room full of stained glass with a bright light she couldn't look at shining through‚Äîshe said the light looked like silver. She saw many people rushing to an open wooden doorway with no door, people from all nations. She rushed to go through too, but a woman at a desk stopped her: "Where are you going?" "Through the door," my mother said. The woman opened a huge book, searched the pages, and said, "Your name's not in the book."
