              üî¢ CHAPTER 4: NUMBERS ADD UP
            </h2>

            <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
              In this chapter I want to look at numbers that are found in almost every text‚Äîwhether they be about the numbers of days or the age of a person or the numbers of people in a certain group. You will always come across numbers, and I have found that they can really add a great deal to a sermon. The following information is from a website called C.A.R.M., Christian Apologetics & Research Ministry. The reason why I want you to read what they have to say about this is because they truly have researched this topic and can break it down better than I can.

              üìñ WHAT IS BIBLICAL NUMEROLOGY?

              <p className="text-gray-800 mb-3">
                It seems quite obvious that the Bible uses numbers in patterns. Who can deny that <strong>40</strong> is significant? Jesus was in the desert for 40 days, and the Israelites wandered in the desert for 40 years. Whether or not the analysis of these number patterns is accurate is up for debate. But I present to you this information condensed from the book Number in Scripture by Bullinger.

              <p className="text-gray-800 mb-2">
                One of the interesting features of Hebrew and Greek is that in both written languages there are no numeric characters. Where we have numbers and letters, they have only letters. So, in each language the letters are also used as numbers. In a small way we do the same thing in English. For example, is "O" a zero or a letter in the alphabet? Is "l" a one or a small L? When they are used, the context tells us which is which and we have no problem understanding it. The same goes for Hebrew and Greek. They knew when they were writing numbers and when they were writing letters.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 mb-2">
                But the interesting thing is that when a word is written, it also has a numeric equivalent. For example, the word "Jesus" in Greek is "iasous." Since each letter has a numeric equivalent, we can add up each number and get a value. The value is the gammatria. Therefore, the gammatria of "Jesus" in Greek is 888 because i = 10, a = 8, s = 200, o = 70, u = 400, s = 200. There are many interesting 'games' that can be played with this feature of Greek and Hebrew and much of it is absurd. But, some of the numeric relationships are interesting.

              <p className="text-gray-800">
                Like I said they know how to explain it better than I would be able to. Whether or not the numbers really do have a significance is still debated in many circles. The main reason is because some people try to find out the end time dates and year based on Biblical numerology, and we know from the Bible no person knows the time of the end. But you will see in the Bible where numbers play a significant part in a lot of texts. Nevertheless, I present the information for your examination.

              I have been taught by some of my teachers the meanings of Biblical numerology. I have also researched a few websites and I've read many commentaries about Biblical numerology.

              Now that I have given you a little information about Biblical numerology let's connect it to the Bible. Let's look at the number four, the number of Creation, the world‚ÄîNorth, South, East, West; four seasons. The fourth commandment is the first that refers to the earth. The fourth clause of the Lord's Prayer is the first that mentions the earth. The materials of the tabernacle were four and so were the coverings and the ornamentations.

                In this story Lazarus has been dead for <strong>four days</strong> and on the fourth day Jesus shows up to resurrect him from the dead. After Lazarus rises from the dead, many people believe in Jesus, so Lazarus became a witness to and for the resurrecting power of Jesus.

              Let's look at another example. Four is the number of the world. It represents man's weakness and helplessness. But 4+1=5 when divine strength is added. We are made perfect in our weakness. The Bible says God's grace is sufficient for us.

              5Ô∏è‚É£ THE NUMBER FIVE - GRACE & REDEMPTION
            </h3>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Five: the number of grace. Redemption. Israel came out of Egypt five in rank (Exodus 13:18). David picked up five smooth stones to fight Goliath (1 Samuel 17:40). The holy anointing oil was pure and composed of five parts (Exodus 30:23‚Äì25).
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Let's look at a story to connect this number to grace.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              "Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel; and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth" (2 Samuel 4:4).
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Mephibosheth was Jonathan's son, King Saul's grandson. The reason why Mephibosheth's nurse was running and fell was because she just found out that her masters, Saul and Jonathan, were killed in battle and she was afraid for Mephibosheth's life. Back in those days when an enemy would kill a king they would usually take the king's position over and rule the kingdom and they would kill all the remaining male family members of the king so they would not grow up and try to avenge their family's throne. So the nurse knew she had to run and try to save the life of the boy that was only five years old. Something happened, though, when this boy got older in the book of 2 Samuel chapter nine:
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              "One day David asked, 'Is anyone in Saul's family still alive‚Äîanyone to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan's sake?' ... His name was Mephibosheth; he was Jonathan's son and Saul's grandson. When he came to David, he bowed low to the ground in deep respect.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              David said, 'Greetings, Mephibosheth.'
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Mephibosheth replied, 'I am your servant.'
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              'Don't be afraid!' David said. 'I intend to show kindness to you because of my promise to your father, Jonathan. I will give you all the property that once belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will eat here with me at the king's table!'
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Mephibosheth bowed respectfully and exclaimed, 'Who is your servant, that you should show such kindness to a dead dog like me?' ... And Mephibosheth, who was crippled in both feet, lived in Jerusalem and ate regularly at the king's table" (2 Samuel 9:1, 6‚Äì8, 13 NLT).
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              You see, King David took the throne of Saul after he died but instead of David looking to kill Saul's family members he was looking to show kindness. Another word for kindness is grace. The reason why David did this was because Jonathan was his best friend and they were really close to each other. One day they made a covenant that when David took the throne he would watch out for Jonathan's family. David kept his word. There is so much insight to this story, like how Mephibosheth's name means "idol exterminator," but we are talking about numbers in this chapter so you're just going to have to study it yourself. Now that we know a little bit about the story of Mephibosheth we can connect the story and the number five to a sermon and say something like this:

              "Sin came into this world through Adam and Eve and we are still dealing with the consequence of their fall and the only way we can get right is by accepting the invitation of the King of kings to come sit at His table of provision and blessing through His Grace. Maybe you have even fallen because someone hurt you and has dropped you from God. Whatever the reason is the King is calling you back, so destroy those idols in your life and humbly bow to His saving grace and become the servant God has called you to be, even though we truly don't deserve it. But that's what Grace is‚Äîsomething not deserved but given anyway!"
