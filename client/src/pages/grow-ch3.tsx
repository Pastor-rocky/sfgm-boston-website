              <p className="mb-2">
                Then the LORD said to Samuel, "I am sorry that I ever made Saul king, for he has not been loyal to me and has refused to obey my command." Samuel was so deeply moved when he heard this that he cried out to the LORD all night.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Early the next morning Samuel went to find Saul. Someone told him, "Saul went to the town of Carmel to set up a monument to himself; then he went on to Gilgal."
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                When Samuel finally found him, Saul greeted him cheerfully. "May the LORD bless you," he said. "I have carried out the LORD's command!"
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                "Then what is all the bleating of sheep and goats and the lowing of cattle I hear?" Samuel demanded.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                "It's true that the army spared the best of the sheep, goats, and cattle," Saul admitted. "But they are going to sacrifice them to the LORD your God. We have destroyed everything else."
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Then Samuel said to Saul, "Stop! Listen to what the LORD told me last night!" "What did he tell you?" Saul asked.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                And Samuel told him, "Although you may think little of yourself, are you not the leader of the tribes of Israel? The LORD has anointed you king of Israel. And the LORD sent you on a mission and told you, 'Go and completely destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, until they are all dead.' Why haven't you obeyed the LORD? Why did you rush for the plunder and do what was evil in the LORD's sight?"
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                "But I did obey the LORD," Saul insisted. "I carried out the mission he gave me. I brought back King Agag, but I destroyed everyone else. Then my troops brought in the best of the sheep, goats, cattle, and plunder to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal."
              </p>
              <p className="mb-3">
                But Samuel replied,
              </p>
              <p className="font-semibold text-red-900 ml-4">
                "What is more pleasing to the LORD:<br/>
                your burnt offerings and sacrifices<br/>
                or your obedience to his voice?<br/>
                Listen! Obedience is better than sacrifice,<br/>
                and submission is better than offering the fat of rams.<br/>
                Rebellion is as sinful as witchcraft,<br/>
                and stubbornness as bad as worshiping idols.<br/>
                So because you have rejected the command of the LORD,<br/>
                he has rejected you as king."

            </h3>

            <p className="mb-4">
              King David takes the Kingdom after Saul and one of the first things he does is bring the ark of the covenant back to Jerusalem. But something happens in the midst of what looked like one of the greatest revivals in Israel with 30,000 people in attendance and every instrument known at that time playing accompanied by singing and dancing. It all came to a stop because of disobedience which led to someone's death!
            </p>

            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-800 my-6 bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded">
              <p className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-3">2 Samuel 6:6-11</p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                But when they arrived at the threshing floor of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out his hand and steadied the Ark of God. Then the LORD's anger was aroused against Uzzah, and God struck him dead because of this. So Uzzah died right there beside the Ark of God.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                David was angry because the LORD's anger had burst out against Uzzah. He named that place Perez-uzzah (which means "to burst out against Uzzah"), as it is still called today.
              </p>
              <p>
                David was now afraid of the LORD, and he asked, "How can I ever bring the Ark of the LORD back into my care?" So David decided not to move the Ark of the LORD into the City of David. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-edom of Gath. The Ark of the LORD remained there in Obed-edom's house for three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and his entire household.
              </p>

            <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-red-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Why did God allow this?
            </h4>

            <p className="mb-4">
              The Bible says that the ark of the covenant was supposed to be carried by the poles that were attached to the ark and then placed on the shoulders of the priest (Deuteronomy 10:8). No one was supposed to touch the ark of the covenant because it represents God's Glory and presence.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Why did David carry the ark on a new cart? The Bible says the Philistines when they stole the ark, years before they placed the ark on a cart (1 Samuel 6:10). <strong className="text-red-900">David tried to bring God's presence in the city the world's way!</strong>
            </p>

            <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-4 my-6 rounded">
              <p className="text-gray-800 mb-3">
                When we try to change our cities with God's Presence we have to do it God's way, not the world's way. Because it does not matter how small or how big the congregation and it's not how many servants you have and how great your choir is, if you are not obeying God and His word we will experience the same thing David did:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-800 space-y-1">

              <p className="text-gray-800 mt-3">
                Also the people will die spiritually, celebration and rejoicing will cease and the blessing of God's presence will go to another house (church/Obed-edom).

After the men who were carrying the Ark of the LORD had gone six steps, David sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf. And David danced before the LORD with all his might, wearing a priestly garment. So David and all the people of Israel brought up the Ark of the LORD with shouts of joy and the blowing of rams' horns.

Do not deviate from them, turning either to the right or to the left. Then you will be successful in everything you do. Study this Book of Instruction continually.

                <p className="text-gray-800">
                  Whatever situation you find yourself in whether it be trial, test or temptation do what the Word says no matter what! Think on the word. (If you don't know what it says in regards to your situation, find out and obey it!)

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-2">
                  If you know you're struggling in a certain area, don't allow yourself to be tempted by going there, watching it, listening to it, and hanging out with certain people and stay away from certain places.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-800">
                  Romans 13:14 says... "But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof". <strong>IN SHORT DON'T SET YOURSELF UP TO FAIL!</strong>

                  I know we covered this in the last section but I can't stress it enough, because the more you read the more you're led to obey that which you have read!

                  Don't get so caught up in preaching the people happy you forget to teach them to obey God in their daily living. You can do this by incorporating application points in your message. (Like if I was teaching people about obeying God I would give them the application points I just gave you! 1. Apply God's Word. 2. Don't set yourself up to fail. 3. Teach others to obey 4. Read the Word daily)
