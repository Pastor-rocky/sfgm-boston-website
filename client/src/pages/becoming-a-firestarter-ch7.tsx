                  Fasting means to abstain from food (to "cover the mouth"). Some people also set aside TV, radio, or negative inputs‚Äîthat's helpful self-denial, but <strong>biblical fasting is abstaining from food</strong> so you deny the flesh and feed the Spirit by spending time with God, becoming more sensitive to His voice and leading. Elijah fasted forty days and heard the still, small voice of God (1 Kings 19:12).

Moses stayed there with the Lord forty days and nights, eating and drinking nothing. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant‚Äîthe Ten Commandments. When Moses went down from Mount Sinai carrying the Ten Commandments, his face was shining because he had been speaking with the Lord; but he did not know it.

                  Fasting declares, "The battle is the Lord's." Judah obeyed‚Äîsending singers ahead in praise. God turned their enemies against each other. When Judah arrived, they found only fallen foes and spent three days gathering plunder (2 Chronicles 20:24‚Äì26).

                I preached this in Chicago for Pastor Leo when his wife, Tonya, was diagnosed with cancer. I wrote "You are healed of cancer" on a chalkboard (hidden), told the church to praise God in advance, then turned the board around. The church prayed, fasted, and worshiped. A week later, doctors declared her cancer free. <strong>Hallelujah.</strong>

                My wife, Gina, and I have seen God move through fasting. When our church needed a permanent building, we entered a 21-day Daniel fast for three things: God's blessing on the ministry, our immediate family, and salvation for our loved ones.
