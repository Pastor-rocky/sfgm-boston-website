              <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-purple-900 mb-3">1. The Greek Definition: More Than a Helper</h4>
              <p className="mb-3">The English word "Deacon" comes directly from the Greek word:</p>
              <p className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-900 text-center mb-3">ŒîŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒøœÇ (pronounced: dee-ah-kon-os)</p>
              <p className="mb-3">While this word is often translated simply as "servant" or "minister," its root meaning is far more powerful and specific.</p>
              <p className="mb-3">It doesn't just refer to a general helper (that would be the Greek word <em>doulos</em>). Instead, <strong>ŒîŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒøœÇ</strong> implies:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-3">
                <li>A trusted attendant</li>
                <li>A designated messenger</li>
                <li>One who executes the commands of another</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In ancient times, a diakonos was not a lowly slave but a respected intermediary who acted with the authority of the person they served. They were a conduit of will and provision.</p>

                  <p className="text-blue-800">When the first deacons were appointed in Acts 6, their service (diakonia) solved a crisis of neglect and allowed the Word of God to spread "and the number of disciples multiplied greatly" (Acts 6:7).

              <p className="text-green-900">A Deacon is a <strong>Spirit-appointed, servant-hearted leader ü§≤ who is trusted with executing the practical ministry of the church</strong>, acting as a conduit of God's love and provision to His people, thereby freeing the church to worship in unity and advancing the Gospel through tangible acts of service.</p>
              <p className="text-center font-bold text-xl text-green-900 mt-4">In a nutshell: Your service is your ministry. Your ministry is your message. ‚ú®</p>
            </div>

            <p className="mb-6">This is the weight and the wonder of the calling. It is a high and holy charge. Now, with this understanding cemented in our hearts, we are ready to explore what this looks like in practice.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">This course wasn't written from a place of theory‚Äîit was written from the fire of experience. üôå I've walked the path you're now considering, and it's my passion to help you walk it boldly and effectively.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">Birthed out of the vision of <strong>SFGM Boston | The House of Restoration Ministries (HRM)</strong>, this journey is built on three pillars:</p>

            <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-4 mb-6">

              </ul>
            </div>

            <p className="mb-4">This isn't about joining a committee. This is a sacred summons to step into a higher level of commitment within the body of Christ. It's about your character being refined in the fires of obedience üî• long before any title is ever placed on you.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">I've been through the battles‚Äîthe spiritual attacks, the setbacks, the breakthroughs. And I've learned this: God's call is irrevocable, and His grace is more than enough for every step‚Äîand every stumble.</p>

            <p className="mb-6">My prayer is that this course doesn't just inform you‚Äîit activates you. May it stir up the gift inside you üïäÔ∏è, equip you for real ministry, and remind you that you're not alone. We're in this together.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">But my journey wasn't all smooth. I hit a rough season. Took a wrong turn. Stepped away from church. For a while, I thought I'd lost my chance‚Äîand my calling.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">Even when I wasn't in church, I was still helping people. Still praying for people. I was a deacon in the desert‚Äîand God never let go of me.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">My comeback wasn't based on my performance‚Äîbut on God's mercy and faithfulness. When I returned, I got back into serving. I was ordained as a deacon. Then God promoted me to elder. And eventually, to pastor.</p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">You said "yes" to the nudge. You acknowledged the whisper of the Holy Spirit. That's powerful. But what happens next? How do you move from a stirring in your spirit to a life fully prepared to walk in the authority, responsibility, and anointing of a deacon?</p>

They must be committed to the mystery of the faith now revealed and must live with a clear conscience. Before they are appointed as deacons, let them be closely examined. If they pass the test, then let them serve as deacons. In the same way, their wives must be respected and must not slander others. They must exercise self-control and be faithful in everything they do. A deacon must be faithful to his wife, and he must manage his children and household well. Those who do well as deacons will be rewarded with respect from others and will have increased confidence in their faith in Christ Jesus."</p>

            <p className="mb-4">My own preparation season was humbling. I thought I was ready. I'd been serving. I knew the Bible. I loved Jesus.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">But I had areas of pride, pockets of immaturity. There were moments I felt frustrated, because I thought I had all the answers.</p>

            <p className="mb-4 font-bold text-purple-900">So I needed to be humbled.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">But God was merciful. He didn't let me step into a space I wasn't ready to hold.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">During that season, I learned to follow before I could lead. I learned that spiritual authority isn't taken‚Äîit's earned through faithfulness, humility, and trust.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">That season of preparation became the most important part of my journey. It wasn't what I did‚Äîit was what God did in me.</p>

            <p className="mb-6">He taught me to lead by example and it was one of the most important lessons of my life.</p>

I felt spiritually dry. The enemy whispered: "See? You stepped up, and things got worse. God's not with you in this."</p>

            <p className="mb-4">But in that wilderness, I learned to fight. I learned to pray not just from my lips, but from my spirit. I learned to lean on my leaders instead of hiding my struggle. I learned that sometimes God allows the battle not to break you, but to make you.</p>

            <p className="mb-6">That season didn't disqualify me‚Äîit activated my spiritual authority.</p>
