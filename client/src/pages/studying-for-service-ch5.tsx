              üìñ CHAPTER 5: THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE
            </h2>

            <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
              In this chapter I want to talk about the power behind the original language. We have seen the importance of names and cities, but in this chapter I want to look at common words and objects in the Bible we pass up, not realizing that they could add so much more application to the sermon. Let's look at some famous verses and some stories in the Bible and learn how to connect them to a sermon.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Jesus said something in Luke chapter 14 that if you didn't study the word "hate" in this text you would have totally ministered this verse wrong. Let's read: "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple" (Luke 14:26). The word hate in the original means to hate, to detest and to love less.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              You can say something like this in reference to this verse: "If you do not hate and detest the things that your family and friends do in the world you cannot serve God. Also, the love you have to have for Jesus should be greater than the love you have for your own family and friends. It's about loving God more than anything else and anyone else in this world and when you can say that, you are truly a follower and witness of Jesus."

              Jesus said we are to be witnesses for Him in this world; this is our mission. In fact, it's the Great Commission. In Acts 1:8 Jesus said, "But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth." The Greek word for witness is m√§r-t√ºs: a witness, those who after his example have proved the strength and genuineness of their faith in Christ by undergoing a violent death. It's where we get our English word for martyr, meaning a person ready to die for their beliefs. So in essence when you called yourself a witness for Jesus, you were saying you were ready to be locked up, whipped, mocked, persecuted, stoned and killed for Jesus! Also, the word "power" in Acts 1:8 is where we get our English word dynamite.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              You can connect it and say something like this: "The early Christians were ready to go through intense persecution and even death for Jesus. They would rather die than betray and denounce their belief in Him. The question is, are you ready to give up the things that are in your lives that are showing you betray Him in your actions and are you ready to not give up on God no matter the trial, tribulation, and test? Because you might not have to die physically for Jesus but you definitely have to die to the things of the world. If you're ready to apply this then you'll be ready to be an effective witness for Jesus that demonstrates the explosive, atmosphere changing, mountain moving power of the Holy Spirit."

              John 3:16; millions of people know this verse of Scripture by heart. But I guarantee only a few have studied it. Let's read: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (John 3:16 NKJV). I've seen people do weeks of teaching on this one verse; as a matter of fact a man by the name of Max Lucado wrote an entire book about this famous verse. I encourage you to study this verse more than you ever have. What I want to show you in this verse is the Greek word for "believe", and I want you to see the fullness of this word we so easily pass up.

              The Bible says even the demons believe there's a God and they tremble at His name (James 2:19). We know they will not have a chance to enter the Kingdom of God, so there has to be something more to this text, and that is we can't just say we believe, we actually have to apply what we say we believe. I'll show you what I mean. Let's look at the original Greek word for the word "believes".

              Let's look at a story about the lame man at the pool of Bethesda. I want to show you something that I've passed over so many times and when I finally checked it up it added to the sermon of the lame man at the pool of Bethesda. A guy from our church heard the preaching and said to me, "It was the greatest anointed preaching I ever heard you preach."
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 font-semibold text-teal-800">
              Let's look at the story:
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              "After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had. Now a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he already had been in that condition a long time, He said to him, Do you want to be made whole? The sick man answered Him, Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me. Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your bed and walk. And immediately the man was made well, took up his bed, and walked" (John 5:1‚Äì9 NKJV).
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Before I tell you the main Greek word let me give you a few good nuggets. The number 38 represents slavery. There were five porches, the number five represents grace. This is confirmed by the name Bethesda. The word Bethesda means "house of mercy". Also, when I was in Israel I went to this pool. There is no more water in this pool, but thank God Jesus is the living water and He can stir up the blessing anytime in us!
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Jesus asked the man, "Do you want to be made whole?", representing your entire life made right‚Äînot just some of it but the whole package. The man responds to the question with complaints and excuses. Jesus didn't ask him why are you not healed but do you want to be healed or made whole. Sometimes we can't hear God right because we are negative and bitter about our situations.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 font-semibold text-gray-800">
              Now let's look at the original word for "infirmity". The Greek word infirmity is where we get our English word anesthesia. Anesthesia does a few things: one, it numbs the senses; two, it makes you forget; three, it covers the pain; and four, it puts you to sleep.

                Jesus asked the man, "Do you want to be made <strong>whole</strong>?", representing your entire life made right‚Äînot just some of it but the whole package. The man responds to the question with complaints and excuses. Jesus didn't ask him why are you not healed but do you want to be healed or made whole. Sometimes we can't hear God right because we are negative and bitter about our situations.

Pick up your mat which represents your problem, because the problem has been controlling you long enough‚Äîit's time for you to control your problem!
