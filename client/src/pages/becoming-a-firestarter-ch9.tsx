                Consider this story (paraphrased from Christian Biography Resources): D. L. Moody, at 18, was a shoe clerk in Boston. His Sunday school teacher, Edward Kimball, prayed and went to the store to speak with him. Nervous about interrupting business, Kimball nearly passed by, but turned back, went in, and briefly told Moody of Christ's love. Moody was ready; he yielded to Christ there in the stockroom. Forty years later, Moody described the joy that flooded his life that day.

After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed his work, walking the streets of New York, the Holy Spirit fell on him. He hid in a friend's room for hours, overwhelmed with God's presence, until he cried out for God to stay His hand. <strong>He rose in the power of the Spirit, and the fire marked his life.</strong>
