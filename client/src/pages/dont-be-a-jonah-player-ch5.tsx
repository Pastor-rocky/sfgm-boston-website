              </div>

              <p>The Bible says that the storm that was coming against the boat was <span className="text-red-300 font-semibold">because of Jonah!</span> People today are going through things they don't have to because of their rebellious attitude towards God. One of the reasons may be because they have no proper knowledge of God's word. They find themselves thinking they are going through trials or tests, or even think that God is doing it to them. All the while it's not a trial, it's not a test, and it's not God‚Äî<span className="text-red-300 font-semibold">it's them!</span> It is discipline for what they are doing and for not being willing to stop!</p>

                  <p>"If you suffer, however, it must not be for murder, stealing, making trouble, or prying into other people's affairs. But it is no shame to suffer for being a Christian. Praise God for the privilege of being called by his name! For the time has come for judgment, and it must begin with God's household. And if judgment begins with us, what terrible fate awaits those who have never obeyed God's Good News? And also, "If the righteous are barely saved, what will happen to godless sinners?" So if you are suffering in a manner that pleases God, keep on doing what is right, and trust your lives to the God who created you, for he will never fail you." 1 Peter 4:15-19 NLT</p>

We have bad attitudes toward those we love, and anyone that comes close to us, because of the storm that is raging inside of us. We are unpredictable.

Indeed you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and under the sun.'" Then David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD."

And since the storm was getting worse all the time, they asked him, "What should we do to you to stop this storm?" "Throw me into the sea," Jonah said, "and it will become calm again. I know that this terrible storm is all my fault." Instead, the sailors rowed even harder to get the ship to the land. But the stormy sea was too violent for them, and they couldn't make it. Then they cried out to the Lord, Jonah's God. "O Lord," they pleaded, "don't make us die for this man's sin. And don't hold us responsible for his death. O Lord, you have sent this storm upon him for your own good reasons." Then the sailors picked Jonah up and threw him into the raging sea, and the storm stopped at once!" Jonah 1:10-15 NLT</p>

                <p>God wants you to repent of the Jonah (rebellious life) you have let in your boat (life) and throw it overboard. When the sailors threw Jonah off the boat, that's when the storms stopped and then there was a great calm! Then the sailors worshipped God.</p>

                  <p>"Then the sailors picked Jonah up and threw him into the raging sea, and the storm stopped at once! The sailors were awestruck by the Lord's great power, and they offered him a sacrifice and vowed to serve him." Jonah 1:15-16 NLT</p>

                <p>What kind of unnecessary storms are you going through because of something you have allowed in your boat? Maybe it's something you have been doing wrong, or something you're avoiding that God is telling you to do?</p>
                
                <p>It's time to allow God to take the Jonah mentality out of your life and allow God to move in your life once again. That is, if you want a great calm like the sailors experienced? The sailors were actually idol worshippers; they didn't serve Jonah's God until they saw what Jonah's God could do! So in essence, Jonah was used to save the sailors and bring them to the true God. Think about how many times God used you even in your rebellion towards Him. Now think how much more He will use you when you become obedient to His will for you! Ask God to remove the unnecessary cargo of sin so you can live a life free from unnecessary storms! Then you can help others live a life without unnecessary storms.</p>

                <p>On my 2018 Israel trip I was on a boat on the Sea of Galilee in Israel. This is where Jesus walked on water and calmed the storm for the disciples. When Peter was walking on water with Jesus in one of the storms, he started focusing on the storm instead of Jesus and began to sink. Peter prayed the shortest prayer in the Bible.</p>

                <p>Why don't you take a moment and pray the same prayer about whatever is going on in your life. Maybe you were serving God at one point in your life, but you looked back at all the problems and it caused you to fall. Today, like Jesus did for Peter, He wants to save you and bring you back to the heart of worship to serve Him again like never before in Jesus' name. It doesn't take a lot of words‚Äîit just takes a heart of sincere faith in the midst of life's storms that truly cries out, <span className="text-blue-300 font-semibold">"Lord, save me!"</span></p>

                <p>I close this chapter with a story.</p>
                
                <p>After a few of the usual Sunday evening hymns, the church's pastor once again slowly stood up, walked over to the pulpit, and gave a very brief introduction of his childhood friend. With that, an elderly man stepped up to the pulpit to speak. "A father, his son, and a friend of his son were sailing off the Pacific Coast," he began, "when a fast approaching storm blocked any attempt to get back to shore. The waves were so high, that even though the father was an experienced sailor, he could not keep the boat upright, and the three were swept into the ocean."</p>
                
                <p>The old man hesitated for a moment, making eye contact with two teenagers who were, for the first time since the service began, looking somewhat interested in his story. He continued, "Grabbing a rescue line, the father had to make the most excruciating decision of his life: to which boy he would throw the other end of the line. He only had seconds to make the decision. The father knew that his son was a Christian, and he also knew that his son's friend was not. The agony of his decision could not be matched by the torrent of waves. As the father yelled out, 'I love you, son!' he threw the line to his son's friend."</p>
                
                <p>"By the time he pulled the friend back to the capsized boat, his son had disappeared beyond the raging swells into the black of night. His body was never recovered."</p>
                
                <p>By this time, the two teenagers were sitting straighter in the pew, waiting for the next words to come out of the old man's mouth. "The father," he continued, "knew his son would step into eternity with Jesus, and he could not bear the thought of his son's friend stepping into an eternity without Jesus. Therefore, he sacrificed his son. How great is the love of God that He should do the same for us." With that, the old man turned and sat back down in his chair as silence filled the room.</p>
                
                <p>Within minutes after the service ended, the two teenagers were at the old man's side. "That was a nice story," politely started one of the boys, "but I don't think it was very realistic for a father to give up his son's life in hopes that the other boy would become a Christian."</p>
                
                <p>"Well, you've got a point there," the old man replied, glancing down at his worn Bible. A big smile broadened his narrow face, and he once again looked up at the boys and said, "It sure isn't very realistic, is it? But I'm standing here today to tell you that THAT story gives me a glimpse of what it must have been like for God to give up His son for me. You see . . . I was the son's friend."</p>
                
                <p>God the Father gave His Son to the storm of sin so we can be saved by the Father through the death of His Son. We can be saved from the storm of sin so we can make a difference and serve God like the son's friend did because he was grateful for the friend's sacrifice.</p>
