              ‚úÖ CHAPTER 8: APPLICATION APPLIED
            </h2>

            <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
              In this chapter I want to teach you how to bring people from hearing to applying what you have shared with them. A lot of ministers minister a word without teaching the people how to apply the information they have given them. Like if I was to say to a person, "If you give in to the devil you're going to live a miserable life and eventually go to hell." That's true but we should show them how not to give in to the enemy and how to live a blessed life and how to make it to heaven.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              In this chapter this is what you're about to learn, because when you teach them how to apply the information, and they do what you have taught them then they will see Jesus manifest in their lives because application brings manifestation!
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Let me share with you why this is so important. I evangelize and go to a lot of churches to minister and at one of these churches I was doing a revival service. After I was done preaching one of the people from the crowd came to me and was encouraging me about the word that I just ministered. So I told him you should really get involved at the church; I said this because he was visiting that church for the second time. He began to explain the reason why he didn't attend the church is because he felt like the pastor doesn't teach them how to apply the information. Then he said how he comes to hear me preach when I'm in that city because I teach people how to apply the information that is ministered. I was encouraged and hurt at the same time. I began to think about how many people aren't going to church because of this same reason. Ask yourself this, do you teach people how to apply the information you have given them? If not let's find out how.

              Let's look at a few stories we have already discussed in the book and learn how to connect the application points. Think about the story of Lazarus in John chapter eleven. How would we teach them to live a resurrected life based on that text? The application can be connected like this:

              Look at the story of Joseph in the book of Genesis chapters 37‚Äì50. Joseph's story was longer than any other story in the Old Testament. If you were to preach a sermon or a series of sermons like I did a few years ago on the story of Joseph, you will see a lot of application points you can take out of Joseph's story, but what I want to do is show you five major points I have seen in this awesome story full of faith and endurance.

              The final example is a sermon outline based on a sermon I ministered. The sermon was called "Living on the Edge." I want to give this example for you to see how you make the transition from the text to the application part and then the closing.

              Living on the Edge

            <p className="mb-6">
              Acts 20:7‚Äì12: On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight. There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting. Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead. Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. "Don't be alarmed," he said. "He's alive!" Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until daylight, he left. The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.

              If you notice they started on the Lord's day but shortly after midnight, early Monday morning, he fell! This is what happens to a lot of people because they are living on the edge, meaning one foot in the church and one foot in the world.

              God has a plan for you. He wants you to prosper and He wants you to hit the mark of his Word and blessing every time and He wants to tell you, "Well done my good and faithful servant," when you enter Heaven! But the devil wants you to fail and forsake everything God has planned for you. The definition for sin means to miss the mark. How does the enemy get you to mess up the plan and blessings God has for you? In this text you notice a couple things.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-2">1. This happens because one eye is on the world and one eye is on Christ; a part of the body is in the world and one part is in church. Living on the edge!</p>

              Hopefully that helps you to understand that in every text or story in the Bible you can pull out application points that people can apply. We have to give them a way out. Give them some way of applying the information given to them. If you're a teacher go through some of your old teachings and see if you can find some application points you can pull out and apply.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              When you do give application points, a good number is usually three to five application points so the people can remember. One of the biggest application points you can make is the importance of the Word of God. This point is in every sermon I have preached. The people need to get in the Word because the Word is the most important thing for their lives because they need to learn how to apply the Word out of church not just in church.
