Also every day visit at least two houses of people that haven't been in church or are not in church. I usually go to another house to check up and encourage those who have been faithful to just let them know I appreciate them.

                  Look for opportunities to impact the cities around you. Start by getting connected to people in the area that have influence over a few people and then start doing Bible studies with them and give them the vision of what you're planning. Then have them help you evangelize and bring people. Schedule a GO date you will start the outreach and then start advertising‚Äîgive at least a month notice. Even if you don't establish a church in this city you would have at least ministered the gospel and it might add members to your church. Also you can even pray about doing outreaches further from your city, let The Spirit lead.

              <p className="text-gray-800 mb-3">
                Gandhi says that one Sunday morning, Gandhi decided he would visit one of the Christian churches in Calcutta, India. Upon seeking entrance to the church sanctuary, he was stopped at the door by the ushers. He was told he was not welcome, nor would he be permitted to attend this particular church as it was for high-caste Indians and whites only. He was neither high caste nor white. Because of the rejection, the Mahatma turned his back on Christianity.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 mb-3">
                With this act, Gandhi rejected the Christian faith, never again to consider the claims of Christ. He was turned off by the sin of segregation practiced by the church. It was because of this experience that Gandhi later declared, <strong>"I'd be a Christian if it were not for the Christians."</strong>

                Because of this one usher's bad example of Christ this man Gandhi turned away from Christ and His church. Now millions of people are gonna go to hell following Gandhi's Buddhism beliefs!

                  I read somewhere, where it said that sheep never eat in the same place twice‚Äîthat's why they are always grazing in the field. They have to eat in different places every time they eat. They're always looking for something new! The church can get very religious sometimes. That's why people leave the church cause they get bored. Let's be sensitive to The Spirit's leading and let's be shepherds that help the sheep eat by changing it up. Invite different ministers, have a Worship service with prayer and intercession, think of doing things outside the "box".

                  A great time to do this is over the Easter holiday. On Palm Sunday do a baptism, Easter do a Special baby dedication service then the Sunday after Easter do a food and fellowship service. Remember to announce these special services a month before to get people to invite their families. These types of services will always attract non-believers because they will come and support their families that are getting baptized and dedicated.

                The Great Commission is not a suggestion‚Äîit's a command. Jesus' final words before ascending to heaven should be our first priority as the church. We cannot afford to be comfortable while 70,000+ people die every day without hearing the name of Jesus.

              <p className="text-gray-800 mb-3">
                The statistics are sobering: 91% of Christian outreach targets other Christians instead of the lost. We're recycling saints instead of rescuing souls. But there's hope! When we follow the Acts 2 model‚Äîdevoting ourselves to teaching, fellowship, prayer, and genuine love‚ÄîGod adds to the church those who are being saved.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 mb-3">
                It's time to move from knowing the Great Commission to doing it. Faith without works is dead. Whether through the 3-2 rule, outreach programs, special events, or simply showing Christ's love to every person who walks through our doors, we must GO!

              <p className="text-gray-800 mb-3">
                Remember Gandhi's tragic story‚Äîone usher's lack of love turned away a man whose influence affected millions. Let's ensure that our churches are known for love, not legalism; for welcoming, not walls; for reaching out, not turning away.

                The harvest is ready. The workers are few. But with Christ's authority backing us and His presence with us always, we can and must WIN souls for the Kingdom of God.
