                <p>For instance, look at what took place with Elijah in the book of 1 Kings. We see that he just experienced a major victory from the Lord, defeating the 850 false prophets of the evil Queen Jezebel. He had help killing all these false prophets because the people of Israel helped him.</p>

And he was afraid and arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there. But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree; and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, 'It is enough; now, O LORD, take my life, for I am not better than my fathers.'"</p>

                  <p>This caused Elijah to run away from Jezebel, resulting in him being alone, driven by fear and isolated from everyone. While Elijah was with his people and they were unified in taking out the enemy he had victory, but as soon as the enemy isolated him, he began expressing his desire to just die!</p>
                  
                  <p className="mt-3">He also exaggerated about how he was the "only" one left out of God's people. God reassured him that there were still 7000 people left that didn't bow down to the idolatry Israel had fallen into. (1 Kings 19:18)</p>

I also gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your care, and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added to you many more things like these! Why have you despised the word of the LORD by doing evil in His sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon. Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.''"</p>

                <p>When I was in Israel in 2018 we went to a location where Jesus was placed in a pit for the night before they put him on trial. I was in this pit‚Äîit is cold, dark, with no windows, and you feel all alone with no hope.</p>
                
                <p>The psalmist prophesies the Messiah's thoughts and prayer regarding his time in this pit. All of Psalms 88 has this prayer but here's just some of it:</p>
                
                <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 mb-4 italic text-gray-200">
                  <p>"I am as good as dead, like a strong man with no strength left. They have left me among the dead, and I lie like a corpse in a grave. I am forgotten, cut off from your care. You have thrown me into the lowest pit, into the darkest depths. Your anger weighs me down; with wave after wave you have engulfed me. Interlude You have driven my friends away by making me repulsive to them. I am in a trap with no way of escape."</p>
