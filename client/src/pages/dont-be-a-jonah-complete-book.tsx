                <p className="text-purple-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Depression, in psychology, a mood or emotional state that is marked by feelings of low self-worth or guilt and a reduced ability to enjoy life. A person who is depressed usually experiences several of the following symptoms: feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or pessimism; lowered self-esteem and heightened self-depreciation; a decrease or loss of ability to take pleasure in ordinary activities; reduced energy and vitality; slowness of thought or action; loss of appetite; and disturbed sleep or insomnia.
                </p>
                <p className="text-purple-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Depression differs from simple grief or mourning, which are appropriate emotional responses to the loss of loved persons or objects. Where there are clear grounds for a person's unhappiness, depression is considered to be present if the depressed mood is disproportionately long or severe vis-√†-vis the precipitating event.

But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them.

                  One of the most common clinical sicknesses around the world is depression! One of the most common side effects of depression is wanting to sleep. Why? You don't want to face the day‚Äîyou would rather sleep your life away than face it. As soon as Jonah gets on the boat he goes to sleep. Many of us are trying to sleep through our lives because we don't want to face the things that come against us.

They look to the hill in front of them and think it's too hard to get where they need to be, so they just end up settling in the valley.

                <p className="text-red-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  God showed me the spirit that is at work in the hearts of the people that are dealing with depression. You see our battle isn't against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces. He showed me this when I was eating at a restaurant one day and I noticed a man I knew in the restaurant that attended our church but was missing regular church attendance for months.

                <p className="text-red-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  So I went up to him, shook his hand and greeted him, and asked how he was doing. He said he was fine. We talked for a few minutes, then we both went back to our tables and a few moments later some people with me at the table asked if I was ok. They asked this because I looked discouraged and was very quiet. I told them I was fine, but they were right; I felt discouraged and depressed. I wasn't earlier, so I began to ask God what was going on with me.

                <p className="text-red-200 leading-relaxed">
                  He ministered to me that the feelings and emotions I was feeling of depression and hopelessness were because the man that was in the restaurant with me was feeling the same mixed emotions!

                </p>
                <p className="text-purple-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  I began to read up and study about the spirit of heaviness right there in the restaurant and found out that this spirit makes you feel hopeless, discouraged, robs your faith, makes you think no one cares, like no one loves you, and stops your praise because you don't feel good enough to serve God. Because of all these emotions it even brings thoughts of suicide!

                  So after finding all this out I went back to the man's table and asked if I can speak to him privately. He agreed and I asked him if he felt any of these things I just mentioned.

I began to tell him that God allowed me to feel what he was feeling to minister the truth to him and to expose the lies of the enemy!

My cousin that was in the house called my uncle, and when he saw me he knew there was something wrong.

              <p className="text-orange-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Jonah was always by himself, alone in the ship, alone on the mountain. He was always alone. Why? Because the enemy wants to get you alone to speak his lies and make you feel like you are by yourself and no one cares.

              <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The Hebrew word for isolation here is the word parad. It means to separate, break into pieces, to divide, to make a division, be out of joint and to break (BLB Lexicon).

              <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
                When you search the Bible you will see it is often when people were alone when the enemy attacked them with discouragement and temptation the most. This caused them to be separated from the people that cared for them. It lead to divisions and even caused people to break God's law‚Äîbreaking covenant with God!

              <p className="text-red-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                For instance, look at what took place with Elijah in the book of 1 Kings. We see that he just experienced a major victory from the Lord, defeating the 850 false prophets of the evil Queen Jezebel. He had help killing all these false prophets because the people of Israel helped him. Something happened after the victory, though‚ÄîJezebel found out and sent messengers to threaten Elijah. This is what she said:

                <p>"Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, 'So may the gods do to me and even more, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.' And he was afraid and arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there. But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree; and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, 'It is enough; now, O LORD, take my life, for I am not better than my fathers.'"</p>

              <p className="text-yellow-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This caused Elijah to run away from Jezebel, resulting in him being alone, driven by fear and isolated from everyone. While Elijah was with his people and they were unified in taking out the enemy he had victory, but as soon as the enemy isolated him, he began expressing his desire to just die! He also exaggerated about how he was the "only" one left out of God's people. God reassured him that there were still 7000 people left that didn't bow down to the idolatry Israel had fallen into. (1 Kings 19:18)
              </p>
              <p className="text-yellow-200 leading-relaxed">
                This is why the enemy wants to get you alone‚Äîto feel like you're the "only" one going through this, you're the "only" one suffering. Then you begin to exaggerate your situation, even though God took you through your biggest battles and you knew you were not alone. You end up running from the lie of the enemy because he has isolated you and such despair has set it that you no longer even want to be around people that can encourage you and lift you up! Because of this, like Elijah we sometimes feel like giving up and saying well we might as well die! We give up hope.

                Another Example is King David. One time while David was king of Israel, he stayed home from a battle instead of leading his army. Kings were supposed to be on the battle field with their men. David felt like his men could take care of the battle, and besides he wanted to be lazy and he slept in that day. The enemy got him by himself, and led David out onto the balcony of his palace where he saw a woman named Bathsheba taking a bath. The enemy got him isolated! David fell for the lust of the eye and ended up committing adultery and even had Bathsheba's husband Uriah murdered to cover up his sin. (2 Samuel 11)

              <p className="text-purple-200 leading-relaxed">
                We find out through the prophet Nathan that David wasn't alone in the spirit realm; the enemy was there with him! The prophet illustrates God's point about how he feels about David's sinful actions. Nathan uses a story about a man that had many sheep and was rich, but took a poor man's one and only sheep that he loved and cared for to prepare it for a "visitor" that visited this rich man. Who was the visitor? The enemy!

Why have you despised the word of the LORD by doing evil in His sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.

                This all started when isolation and laziness came into David's life.

                I was initially going to incorporate this information in the previous chapter, but I feel this is a specific word that deserves its own chapter. I want to talk about going through what people sometimes refer to as a "hell experience." This goes beyond an unnecessary storm; this is where you're drowning from the storm and all hell is breaking loose around you and it causes you to cry out to God like never before. Many times people have to go a through a breaking of self in order for them to come to their senses. This is the case with Jonah.

It's hot and smelly, and acid is burning your skin, while water keeps coming in and out of the stomach of the fish and each time you almost drown. He's tired, weary, exhausted, can't fight off sleep any longer, and the pressure of being deep down in the depths of the sea is now making him delirious. He begins to realize if he dies, not only is he going through a hell of an experience, but he just might enter into hell if he dies.

                When you truly understand what God has done for you and the grace He has given you, it changes you. Grace is something we didn't deserve but was given to us anyway by Jesus. We didn't deserve heaven, we didn't deserve a second chance, we didn't deserve the ultimate sacrifice of the Son of God, and we didn't deserve to be able to serve Jesus, but it was given to us anyway!

                Mercy is stopping the punishment we deserve because of what we all have done. We did deserve death, hell, and the grave. We did deserve the lashes on our backs and the cross that Jesus took for us. Jesus loved us so much that He gave us the grace we didn't deserve and stopped the hell we did deserve. That's mercy!

                Here's the good news: God is a God of second chances. The Bible says that the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time. Throughout the Bible you see the stories of great men and women of God who fell but came back stronger and greater for the Glory of God. Too many people feel condemned and think they can't come back to God because they wandered too far away and did too much to hurt God. Sadly, they fall for the lie of the enemy that tells them they're too far gone to get back to who God has called them to be. The devil is a liar!

They would take a bunch of maggots and squish them and then take the blood and use that as the dye for the color scarlet. It was a very deep red unlike you could get anywhere else. It was nearly impossible to wash the stain of the scarlet color away that was made with the maggots' blood.

The silk worm would attach itself to a tree when it was about to give birth, and as it gives birth it dies on the tree to give life to its children. After the birth is complete, and the worm falls from the tree after it dies, all that remains is a bloodstained tree from a worm!

This eased his discomfort, and Jonah was very grateful for the plant. But God also arranged for a worm! The next morning at dawn the worm ate through the stem of the plant so that it withered away. And as the sun grew hot, God arranged for a scorching east wind to blow on Jonah. The sun beat down on his head until he grew faint and wished to die. "Death is certainly better than living like this!" he exclaimed. Then God said to Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry because the plant died?" "Yes," Jonah retorted, "even angry enough to die!" Then the Lord said, "You feel sorry about the plant, though you did nothing to put it there. It came quickly and died quickly. But Nineveh has more than 120,000 people living in spiritual darkness, not to mention all the animals. Shouldn't I feel sorry for such a great city?"</p>

                God gives Jonah a personal illustration using a very hot wind, a plant, and a worm! Jonah preached the message of repentance, but he still had no compassion for the people. He was actually upset that God showed mercy on the people of Nineveh, so God shows him an illustration that represents a few things. First of all, it was so hot Jonah wished he was dead. The heat illustrated hell, where the people of Nineveh deserved to go for their wickedness. The plant can represent life. In the Gospel of John, Jesus said we are like branches and He is the vine. The worm represents the disgusting consequences of our sin. The Bible says hell is where the worm never dies (Mark 9:48).

We are all called to help save souls by warning them of hell and eternal damnation, and to remind them of God's grace and mercy.

You would have been much more likely to think the exact opposite. The Assyrians of Jonah's day were a ruthless and evil people. They had a reputation for showing no mercy to their enemies, and committing atrocities such as decapitating prisoners. So the question is, why would they listen to the prophet Jonah? And not just listen‚Äîthe king of Nineveh got off his throne, put on sackcloth, and sat down in ashes. Many people in the city copied the king's behavior. The king called for citywide fasting, repentance, and prayer in hopes that the Lord would show mercy to them.

                There could have been a couple reasons why Nineveh would repent like they did when they heard the warning of Jonah. One of those reasons could have been because there were signs and wonders in the heavens, like a solar eclipse which they have never seen; this is confirmed by astronomers in the same time period in which Jonah was warning the city of Nineveh. The eclipse would have lasted for hours, which may have struck fear and confusion in them.

                Consider the basic facts of an eclipse‚Äîthe sun is blocked by the moon while it is in rotation, which causes the light to be shut out and darkness to affect the land. God is saying, through Jonah, that this is what the people of Nineveh did; they shut out the light and allowed evil to overtake the land and bring darkness and disaster on themselves. But God brought the light to shine on them again through Jonah and the Word of the Lord. Jesus said we are the light of the world (Matthew 5:18).

              <p className="text-purple-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The second reason why Nineveh may have repented is that at the time of Jonah going to Nineveh, there was a false god they would worship named Dagon who was half man and half fish (pictured). Thats right, imagine it‚Äîthe people of Nineveh are already wondering what's going on in the heavens and now they see a large fish, possibly a whale, pull up on their shores. They see this fish open its mouth and out comes a man‚Äîpossibly bleached white from the acid in the fish's stomach. I imagine whoever saw this ran to the city to tell others, and it spreads like wild fire so by the time Jonah began to minister about repentance they were ready to do whatever this man who came out of the fish said.

              <p className="text-purple-200 leading-relaxed">
                God used what the enemy meant for bad‚Äîa rebellious man of God running from the Lord's will because of bitterness‚Äîand used the fish as a vehicle to get Jonah from where he was to where he needed to be. God used Jonah and the fish to reveal that He alone is the one true God and that they needed to turn from their idols like Dagon.

God used all of these men and women of God that rebelled against Him‚Äîwhat an incredible way to show us that no matter how rebellious you may be, God can use your past as a place of hope for someone's future.

The very place where Jonah was meant to go preach. The very thing that had swallowed Jonah up, the very thing that should have destroyed him, was the very thing that took him right into the center of God's will for His life. And the same applies even to this very day. You're reading this book right now, and you too can turn your whale into a taxi cab. It's no accident.

                Remember, the people of Nineveh worshipped a half-fish, half-man God named Dagon. So it was only natural that when they saw Jonah, a man being spit out by a giant fish onto the shore with a message from God, that they listened and obeyed. All of Nineveh repented of their sin and the will of God was done. The story truly is a story of repentance. God used the whale as the means by which Jonah reached his destination. God used the whale as the means by which the attention of the Ninevites was captured. The whale was the stage for Jonah's sermon.

If you'll put it in God's hands, He can take these things and use them as the stage from which to preach the message God has for you. Maybe not a message of words, but a message of your life‚Äîyour story of what God has brought you through. Your testimony of what God has done for you. What you went through can become the thing that opens people up to receive what God is speaking through you. The whale wasn't meant to kill Jonah, it was meant to help him do God's will and save people.

                I'm writing this chapter as I'm on a plane flying home from Israel. I was there on a tour, filming a DVD teaching series we are putting together. We believe people will be encouraged and inspired as they watch footage of us teaching the truths explored in this book, captured right at the very locations where these events took place in the Bible.

                Thats right‚Äîthe very location where Jonah had to decide to either go his own way or follow the Lord's way. Modern-day Joppa is a night time party scene, filled with lights and glitz and glamor. It's actually one of the biggest party spots in Israel. We have to choose between the glamor of the world and the calling of God. While I was there I couldn't help think about the decision he made and the price he paid for it. There is always a price to pay to go against God‚Äîit comes due just like any other bill, and Jonah had to pay a steep price.

              <p className="text-purple-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                When you look at the name Jonah, you will discover that his name has a dual meaning. Jonah means both dove or destruction. Think about that‚Äîthe dove in the Bible is a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Destruction is a representation of the devil, because this is what he wants to do to people; he wants to steal, kill, and destroy.

              <p className="text-purple-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                When Jonah didn't listen to God, and instead tried to do what he wanted to do, everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong. Destruction followed Jonah wherever he went and it affected whoever he was around. When he finally came to his senses, and did what God wanted him to do, and listened to the Holy Spirit‚Äîpeople got saved and delivered.

                Look at what Galatians chapter six says, and reflect on the dual meaning of Jonah's name: There is a Biblical principle that when you follow your flesh, you are sowing corruption and destruction‚Äîand that which you sow is what you will reap. On the other hand, if you follow the Holy Spirit and do what God wants, you are sowing everlasting life and you will reap what you sow. You'll have everlasting life, and those who you sow the Word of God into will reap everlasting life as well.

                The reason I put the picture of modern-day Joppa on the cover of the book is as a symbol of what we have to decide between. Do we want the glitz, glamour, and bright lights of this world, or do we give in to the Holy Spirit? Knowing that we are in this world but we're not of this world‚Äîwe are, like the Bible says, aliens just passing through.

There was something else that happened in the days of preaching to the people of Nineveh‚Äîthis eclipse that made the city of Nineveh go dark for a time. When Jesus was dying on the cross, the Bible says that the whole land went dark for a time; from twelve to three in the afternoon darkness covered the land (Luke 23:44).

                  "did you know that a total solar eclipse appears to have played a role in the story of the Biblical prophet Jonah? First, of course, we have to decide whether Jonah was a fictional character or a real, historical person. If you've read my three-part article "Historicity: Does It Matter?" you'll know what I think. Taking Jonah to be historical as I do, the Bible's one specific clue as to when he lived was during the reign of Jeroboam II, or around 786-746 BCE, if we take 2 Kings 14:25 as evidence of the latest that he could have prophesied.

                  A total solar eclipse over Nineveh in northern Iraq on June 15, 763 BCE fits this time frame for the life and career of Jonah. Assyriologist Donald Wiseman, a former curator at the British Museum, and editor of Chronicles of Chaldean Kings and The Alalakh Tablets, published a lecture in the Tyndale Bulletin in 1979 where he argued persuasively that this eclipse would help explain the dramatic reaction to Jonah's preaching. to the Assyrian writings cited by Wiseman, here's what a solar eclipse would have meant to them: "the king will be deposed and killed, and a worthless fellow will seize the throne...rain from heaven will flood the land...the city walls will be destroyed.""

                I believe that Jonah was in Nineveh in June of 763 BC during the total eclipse of the sun, which would help explain the remarkable response of the people of Nineveh. Jonah preaches at exactly the right time for the people of Nineveh to listen to him. The Assyrian nation was weak and in chaos in the decade around 760 BCE. They had one earthquake (one sign of divine wrath). There was a famine from 765-758 BCE. Assyria was losing battles and losing territory to its enemies. There were domestic riots. With all the trouble they already had going on, they could have easily believed that Jonah's warning would come to pass.

The point is, can this be a sign that we are in the last days? Can this be a sign that Jesus is about to bring judgment unless our nations repent? Can this be a sign that we have to get ready for the coming of the Son of Man? I believe the answer to all these questions is yes. The Bible says God gives us signs concerning the stars and the moon and even the sun.

                Think about this‚Äîthe evil Assyrians in Jonah's day are like the same people in our present day called ISIS. A few years ago back I was watching the news and they was reporting on how the terrorists called ISIS are an Assyrian based group and they bombed the tomb of Jonah. When I saw this it was a confirmation for me to write this book. The reason why they bombed Jonah's tomb was because he brought the Word of the Lord first to the city of Nineveh. I believe we have many signs of Jonah in our lifetime appearing and it's time to stop running from the call and start running to the call that God has placed on our life.

              <p className="text-purple-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The original word for ambassador in America was minister; at least five presidents of the United States were ambassadors before becoming president. An ambassador is a person that resides in another country while representing their own country. They stay in an embassy, and from there they conduct the business of representing their country and its citizens in that foreign country.

              <p className="text-purple-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                They also grant immunity to people. Immunity is the act of stopping prosecution or penalties to be charged against a person by the government of a foreign country. If an individual is found guilty of certain crimes, they sometimes faces expulsion from the foreign country‚Äîsent back to their own country with no charges applied. Some ambassadors have been assassinated while on foreign ground because they were trying to represent their country and defend their people.

                What's the point? Jesus came down from heaven to this earth to grant immunity to the world that was guilty and deserved death and hell, but He pleaded for us and won the case.

                For me, the place I started to minister was my hometown of Chicago. I was the most worst person‚Äîa real chief sinner before my born-again experience. So when God called me to minister, I thought he wanted me to go to a completely different city where no one knew me, because I felt there was no way that the people where I grew up were going to take me seriously. I hurt a lot of people. I was in trouble with five of the biggest families in Chicago for a lot of different reasons. I thought there was no way that God would tell me to start a ministry in Chicago. But He did; He truly used all my past as the testimony of His saving and changing Grace. In Chicago is where Soldiers for God Ministry (SFGM) started.

The best part was that it was the same church I attended for fifteen years of my life. A few years later we paid it off and remodeled both buildings. God was truly pouring out His favor on us. Many ministers were raised up in that church, five of whom planted their own ministries. Many families were raised up to serve the Lord and over fifteen marriages were established from the direct connection of the church.

              <p className="text-yellow-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I ministered in Chicago from 2007 until something happened in 2016. I was on vacation in Orlando, Florida, where I usually would take my family on vacation, but this time destiny began to reveal itself like never before. Let me explain. For over a year I kept feeling like God wanted me to do an outreach in Orlando. I thought that God wanted me to plant a church like before. It never occurred to me what God was about to do.
              </p>
              <p className="text-yellow-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                While on vacation in Orlando, one of my guys that lived there asked me to do a Church service while I was there. I told him I was on vacation and I would come back and do a service‚ÄîI randomly said November 3rd, or so I thought it was a random date. I flew back home from Orlando to Chicago on a Sunday morning. When I got home, I began to pray before our evening service and I told God, "I'm sorry for telling the people of Orlando I was going to come there without asking you first, so I will not go to Orlando unless you confirm it."
              </p>

              <p className="text-purple-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Three hours later the service started. While it was going on, I noticed an American man and woman walk into the service, so at the end of the service I greeted them. They explained how they grew up in that church, and I told them I did too. Then I realized they left the church right around the same time I started attending there. Then he shared how he had just gotten off a plane from Orlando hours before he walked into the church. I told him I just got off a plane from Orlando, too. He said he was on vacation and wanted to visit the church he grew up in, and then said God sent him to Orlando, Florida, and he has a thriving ministry there.

              <p className="text-purple-200 leading-relaxed">
                It completely blew me away because I knew this was the confirmation I needed to start an outreach in Orlando. Although it was more than that.

              <p className="text-orange-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I had family and friends set up a banquet hall in Orlando for November 3rd. Also, I had one of my guys from Dallas, Texas fly out and one of my guys from Chicago go with me, thinking maybe they would be potential candidates for the church in Orlando.
              </p>
              <p className="text-orange-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                On October 30th, I get a phone call that my grandmother in New Jersey passed away. I began to worry because I would have to cancel the service in Orlando to go to the funeral in New Jersey. My family told me something that shocked me‚Äîthey said the funeral would be November 2nd and the burial on the 3rd, and it would be all done in Orlando!
              </p>
              <p className="text-orange-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I questioned my family why would they burry my grandmother in Orlando if we didn't have any other family buried there. They explained how she wanted to be put to rest in Florida. I felt great about it because I could still honor my grandmother and not have to cancel the service. It worked out perfectly‚ÄîI thought maybe it was too perfect, not knowing it was all by God's divine design.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4 text-blue-300">üèõÔ∏è Biblical Principle of Burial</p>
              <p className="text-blue-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                When we got to Orlando I conducted the funeral, and then on November 3rd we go to the burial ground to lay my grandmother to rest. While they were finishing up the burial, I noticed her last name Lee was on the head stone and I thought about when I was born I was named by my mothers last name of Lee. Why does this matter? God placed in my mind something that represented a Biblical principle that had to do with burial.
              </p>
              <p className="text-blue-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Burial location was very important in Biblical days, and even now for Jewish people‚Äîsomething the gypsy people have in common with them. One reason the burial place was so important is it has to do with God's promise of the land. God had promised that Abraham's descendants would possess the land where he had been buried (Genesis 12:1-3). Also, Jacob knew that if he was buried in Canaan, his tomb would forever remain within the Promised Land. The fact that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob would all be buried there‚Äîthree generations‚Äîemphasized their belief in God's promise to give this land to their family.
              </p>
              <p className="text-blue-200 leading-relaxed">
                Burial was a mark of land ownership. The gypsy community also lay claim to a city by claiming their dead are buried there. So as I was thinking of all this, I said, "Lord, what are you doing?" Then God revealed to me that every Gypsy pastor that has ever ministered in Orlando never had any dead buried there. But I just thought it was just me and I'm always trying to connect things Biblically.

              <p className="text-green-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                That night we had an amazing service in Orlando with about sixty-five people. The anointing was strong and I ministered a message I had preached in Chicago weeks before about how your past doesn't determine your future. It was about Jephthah from the book of Judges chapter eleven. A person in the Bible that was rejected by his family and friends because they were ashamed of him, but later begged him for his help to fight against the enemy that was coming against them. They wanted his help because he was a mighty warrior and soldier.
              </p>
              <p className="text-green-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Then I called up the guys that I brought with me to say something for a few minutes. After they were done, God told me, "It isn't for them it's for you!" Then He showed me the people in the crowd, many were from Chicago but now live in Orlando. Like Jephthah, they rejected me and wanted nothing to do with me but God was about to make me their leader to help them fight against the enemy.
              </p>
              <p className="text-green-200 leading-relaxed">
                He also showed me that just like a shepherd goes after the lost sheep, He was sending me to the lost sheep from Chicago now living in Orlando‚Äîwhich were at least one hundred people. They were not serving God and many were hurt and let down by other pastors and leaders in the past.
              </p>

            <div className="bg-red-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg border border-red-400/30 mb-6">

              <p className="text-red-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Again I thought maybe this is the enemy trying to confuse me, and trying to get me to leave a blessed people and a ministry that was in the midst of revival back in Chicago. At this time we were experiencing a mighty outpouring from God‚Äîthere were five consecutive Sundays where we had to pull out extra chairs because there was no room. Most importantly, God was gracing us with His presence like never before and lives where changing. Also, we were raising up leaders that were about to start their own ministries.
              </p>
              <p className="text-red-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                So I left Orlando very confused, trying to understand if this was the enemy or God? When I got back home I told Gina my wife what I thought God was telling me, and she told me I was crazy and that she's not leaving. I told her she was right and she walked out of the room.
              </p>
              <p className="text-red-200 leading-relaxed">
                Then she came back and reminded me about when we were in Orlando in the winter of 2009 on vacation. I was outside next to the van we were about to get into, praying on the ground for the city of Orlando because I felt a heaviness for the people in the city. I got back in the car and I told her that, "I believe God wants me to be a pastor here one day." I was blown away because I totally forgot about that statement. This made her think maybe it is God bringing this to pass now. But both of us were still confused and scared thinking about whether this was God.

                Then, over the course of a couple weeks, people began to come up to me saying they were having dreams that I was a minister in Florida and they were worried I was going to leave. At the same time, people were calling and saying that God was showing them that He was sending me to Orlando. I began to feel pressured and even depressed, wondering how I was going to leave my congregation, my family, my daughter, and granddaughter, my church and house that's paid off and a city and people that loves me‚Äîwell, most of them. Not to mention a very good salary.
              </p>
              <p className="text-purple-200 leading-relaxed">
                I mean, pastors leave when things are bad not when things are good, right? Believe me, I wanted to leave many times but God always got me through my little pity parties. This was a time in the ministry that Gina and I definitely didn't want to leave; everything was going so well and we felt like we were in harvest season.

              <p className="text-blue-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I called my Administrative Bishop and explained what I was feeling and told him that I thought it might be the enemy trying to confuse me to get me out of my position. He responded with something that made me shift my thinking. He said, "Let me get this straight‚Äîyou think the enemy is trying to get you to open up a ministry where people need it so they get saved and set free?" It made me look at this whole thing from a different perspective.
              </p>
              <p className="text-blue-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I began to lose sleep, getting up in the middle of the night, thinking God if you want me to go I'll go. Then the heaviness would lift, but when I would wake up in the morning I would say no way, I can't leave‚Äîand then the heaviness would come back. Then I began to think about how around the second year of the ministry in Chicago I was explaining how I believed at the tenth year of the ministry God was going to send me somewhere else. I remember the guys getting upset with me and me telling them I would only leave if God put a burden upon me that I couldn't handle and gave me confirmations that I couldn't deny. All these things God was reminding me of I had totally forgotten, but God was showing me He had this planned from the beginning. It was no coincidence my ministry in Chicago was months away from its tenth-year anniversary.

                Gina and I began to pray and fast, asking for more confirmation. Then Gina recommended that I call a pastor friend of mine that truly works in the prophetic to come preach on a Wednesday night. I did, but I didn't call‚ÄîI texted him because I didn't want him to hear the burden and hurt in my voice. If this was God He would use Him without me saying anything. So I text him and said, "Hey man, need a word." That's it. He didn't reply back until the next day, because he was on vacation, but God told him get off his vacation and come preach for me. I was excited for him to come because he prophesied many things for me and our church that God fulfilled.
              </p>
              <p className="text-yellow-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                So right before the fast was over, I felt a warm circular feeling around my heart that I have never felt before with my walk with God. I felt God say to me, "As Abraham left everything, I am telling you to do the same." Because I kept complaining to God and questioning Him, asking how He could expect me to leave everything and everybody I have in Chicago. So I told Gina, "The pastor that's coming, he has to preach about how Abraham left everything‚Äîthat's how I will know this is really God." Then she told me that God told her there's going to be a shift in the church, and that's what the pastor had to say too.

                Wednesday came and we purposely went to church late. We didn't want to talk to anyone, especially the pastor. We wanted to see if this was really God. I gave him the mic and acted like everything was ok. He started off by saying how he felt a sorrowful spirit in the church; it was obviously me and Gina. He then began to explain how he wanted to preach another message, but God changed his message and he had to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit and needed to preach what God told him.

He was there for only a short time, and his life had changed so dramatically and I was worried he would be hurt and leave the church. He explained how he would have been upset with me leaving, but God had to tell him first. I asked what do you mean?

As I was looking at the scene, God reminded me of a dream I had years ago. I was in Florida and I got out of a burgundy car and walked into the house of a minister that used to be in Orlando but fell away from serving the Lord. In the dream I was rebuking him and encouraging him to stop being a bad witness and start serving the Lord again. In the background on a radio in the house was playing a preaching called a call you can't ignore‚Äîthe message was about Jonah. In the dream I'm telling the minister you have to repent. At the time he was upset, but after I told him that he got up, started crying, and fell on me as his tears began to hit my face.

                Many people want to open up ministries in their own hometown because they're comfortable. I didn't start a ministry in Chicago because it was convenient; I did it because I was called and confirmed. And when I left, there were hundreds of people, money in the bank, and a person to take over leadership. Glory to God. Wherever you are and wherever you go, make sure it's because God has called you there. Don't be a Jonah‚Äîaccept your Nineveh!

                When you look at the differences of Jonah's and Jesus' legacy, they are very different. Jonah's story ends with a question mark (see Jonah 4:11). Jesus' story actually never ends, obviously‚Äîbut in the Bible before He ascends to heaven He commissioned His disciples to go and change the world (Matthew 28). Why did his disciples and millions after them suffer pain, humiliation, and even death for the cause of Christ? Simple‚Äîbecause of the legacy that Jesus left that inspired their lives even unto death.

                My question is this: after you leave this earth, will you leave a legacy that inspires others to turn to Jesus or turn from Jesus? Personally, after God takes me home to be with the Lord, I want to know that even after my time is done here on earth that God will continue to use me. I pray that long after I am gone, the teachings God gave me to minister, the books He has allowed me to write, and the life He allowed me to live for His Glory, will still be shared, read, and talked about from generation to generation. Why? Simple, because I want God to use all that He allowed me to do for Him to point many more to Him even after I'm gone.

                Choose to live for Jesus here and live a life that after you're gone you will still point people to the resurrected Christ! As I was preparing this chapter, I began to think about a story in the Bible about the prophet Elisha. Elisha was a prophet under the prophet Elijah, one of the most powerful and influential prophets ever. Elisha learned everything from his mentor Elijah's great examples concerning the things of God.
              </p>
              <p className="text-yellow-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Elisha was also a powerful man of God that received a double portion of Elisha's anointing on his life. Elisha lived and served God and he influenced many for the glory of God. The verse you are about to read actually has to do with what God did through the prophet Elisha‚Äînot while he was living but after he died.

              <p className="text-red-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The prophet was dead and his bones laid in a burial site. Now, before the prophet Elisha took the place of his predecessor Elijah, he asked Elijah for a double portion of the anointing that was on Elijah's life (2 Kings 2:9). God ended up granting Elisha's request. The prophet Elijah was used by God to perform fourteen miracles, ranging from prophesies fulfilled, stopping the rain for a time, to raising the dead. The prophet Elisha died after performing twenty seven miracles, one short of the double portion blessing‚Äîor so we thought.

Jesus slept on a boat during a storm, and "rebuked the wind and said to the waves, 'Quiet! Be still!' Then the wind died down and it was completely calm." (Mark 4:35-41). Jonah caused a storm. Jesus had authority over the storm.

                  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-yellow-300">Introduction</h2>
                  <p>There are so many people in this world that are believers of Jesus Christ that are still going through life with no purpose, no goals, and no determination or plan to even change. There are also nonbelievers going through these same types of things in their life. On top of all this both nonbelievers and believers alike are facing all kinds of problems in their life like isolation, depression, discouragement, bitterness, suicidal thoughts, and unnecessary storms that are affecting them and the people around them. They have been swallowed up by all these life problems.</p>
                  <p>Have you ever felt like you have been swallowed up and you feel like you are being consumed by all that is coming against you? You don't have to stay there! In life's hopeless situations it is usually the time where God is about to do something that will forever change your life either for good or for bad, the question is only what do you want the outcome to be? It is time to come out and step into your calling!</p>
                  <p>The Bible says in the book of Psalms, "Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor in vain" (Psalms 127:1). The Hebrew word for vain provides a few different definitions‚Äîworthlessness, nothingness, disaster, and emptiness. This is why so many people are experiencing such devastation in their life. They are going through this because they're not allowing God to build and guide their lives because they are too busy trying to do it themselves.</p>
                  <p>The reason for this is because whether they realize it or not they are running from the call that God has for their life! This call is the call of salvation, sacrifice, sanctification, and service. The only way to experience blessing, prosperity, fulfillment, peace, joy, and eternal life is answering the call of God to surrender to Him, serve Him, and obey Him with your heart and not just your mouth! God does not want just lip service, He wants heart service! God searches the heart.</p>
                  <p>If you are tired of being empty, void, and discouraged and you want help to get out of the rut you're in and you're looking for direction to truly live a life pleasing unto God, then get ready because you are about to find out how by studying the story of Jonah found in The Bible. We will look at this prophet of God that knew the voice of God, knew the word and plan of God, but ran from the presence and call of God. He then experienced many problems because of this, then after many unnecessary storms he repented of his stubborn and rebellious attitude and answered the call that was on His life!</p>
                  <p>We will learn from Jonah the repercussions of not serving and we will also find out the rewards and blessings of serving God by answering the call of God.</p>
                  <p>Will you continue to run from God's call or will you stop and receive it? I Pray you will answer the call that God has for your life so you will truly stop running like Jonah and start serving like Jesus! Let the journey begin.</p>
                  
                  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-yellow-300">Chapter 1: Fighting Against God</h2>
                  
                  <div className="mb-6">
                    <p className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4 text-blue-300">üìñ Jonah 1:1-4 NLT</p>

                      <p>The Lord gave this message to Jonah son of Amittai: "Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh. Announce my judgment against it because I have seen how wicked its people are."</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-red-400 pl-4 mb-4 italic text-gray-200">
                      <p>But Jonah got up and went in the opposite direction to get away from the Lord. He went down to the port of Joppa, where he found a ship leaving for Tarshish. He bought a ticket and went on board, hoping to escape from the Lord by sailing to Tarshish.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 pl-4 mb-6 italic text-gray-200">
                      <p>But the Lord hurled a powerful wind over the sea, causing a violent storm that threatened to break the ship apart.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                  </div>

                  <p>God speaks by calling out to Jonah and telling him there's a city called Nineveh and a people there that are very wicked and need help. God tells Jonah, I'm choosing you to go and minister a Word to warn them!</p>
                  
                  <p>Sounds like a perfect job for a prophet of God, especially because this is the calling that God has chosen for Jonah‚Äîand Jonah is not ignorant of his calling. Instead of Jonah embracing the mission and call that God has for him, he runs from the presence of God and goes down to Joppa to board a ship that's headed to a city called Tarshish. I want to look at the cities in this chapter and explain the meanings of each city and how they apply to someone who is running from God.</p>
                  
                  <p>The Hebrew word for Joppa means beautiful. People that are running from God's call constantly try to fill a void in their life by trying to fill that void with "beautiful" things, like materialistic possessions maybe:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
                    <li>a car</li>
                    <li>house</li>
                    <li>clothing</li>
                    <li>or jewelry</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>These things might bring happiness for a moment but it will soon fade and you will begin looking for the next new car, house, and new trending designer, or the next beautiful place to go and visit. These "beautiful" things will never fill the void in your life; only God will fill the void when you embrace and receive the calling that God has for your life! Now don't get me wrong‚Äîit is not sin to have beautiful material things, just as long as those beautiful things don't have you!</p>

                        <p>As Jesus was starting out on his way to Jerusalem, a man came running up to him, knelt down, and asked, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" "Why do you call me good?" Jesus asked. "Only God is truly good. But to answer your question, you know the commandments: 'You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely. You must not cheat anyone. Honor your father and mother.'" "Teacher," the man replied, "I've obeyed all these commandments since I was young." Looking at the man, Jesus felt genuine love for him. "There is still one thing you haven't done," he told him. "Go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." At this the man's face fell, and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.</p>

                      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-red-400 pl-4 mb-4 italic text-gray-200">
                        <p>Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!" This amazed them. But Jesus said again, "Dear children, it is very hard to enter the Kingdom of God. In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!"</p>
                      </blockquote>

                    <p>This rich young ruler didn't seem like too bad of a person, but he wasn't wiling to let go of the beautiful things that were holding him back from the call Jesus had for him. Jesus said, "Come follow me," but he wasn't willing, so he walked away disappointed and discouraged. This is how people walk around when they're putting the things of the world in front of serving Jesus. You don't have to walk around like this; all you have to do is trust God and let go and let God move in your life.</p>

                    <p>Some times people even try to go to "beautiful" places in an attempt to change the atmosphere around them to make them feel better. This does not work, because you can try to change all you want on the outside but it will never help you on the inside; it will never fill the void of the calling in your life. A few years ago I was in Israel and I was able to visit Joppa. It is truly beautiful‚Äîthe atmosphere is amazing. The city sits on a natural bay on the Mediterranean Sea, with beautiful beaches loaded with tall green palm trees. What's not to like about Joppa? But if a person is running from God, I don't care how attractive a place is, you will not have joy, rest, or peace of mind. Jonah was there all while running from God; it's not about your location, it's about the destination that God has for you! For Jonah it wasn't Joppa, it was Nineveh.</p>

                    <p>Just like the cities around us today that God has chosen us to impact, influence, and ignite the fire of God in their lives! It is time to stop running to the "beautiful" things and places for fulfillment‚ÄîGod has the fulfillment you need and you will only receive it when you are willing to allow God to change your life and the life of others around you through His Son Jesus!</p>

                    <p>In the New Testament, in Acts chapter 10, the disciple Peter was staying at Simon the tanners house in the city of Joppa and God showed him a vision. Basically, the vision was a representation of what he was to do regarding the Gentiles (non-Jewish people). God showed him he was to minister to the Gentiles about Jesus. At this point, no Jewish disciple was ministering to non-Jewish people, but Peter received the call from Joppa to minister to a sinful people. Even though it was against what he felt, he did what Jesus wanted him to do! It is time for us to do the same.</p>

Without realizing it, you like Jonah will be headed for Tarshish. What do I mean when I say this? Well, the Bible says Jonah paid the fare to go to Tarshish; when we run from our call we will begin to pay for our rebellious and stubborn attitudes. The Hebrew word Tarshish means "to break or fight against." The Bible says God sent a storm and the ship Jonah was on was about to break up!</p>

                        <p>Then Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and asked letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. As he journeyed he came near Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from heaven. Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?" And he said, "Who are You, Lord?" Then the Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. It is hard for you to kick against the goads."</p>

                    <p>A goad was a shepherd's stick with spikes on it. It was used to discipline the stubborn sheep and oxen so that they would follow the path the shepherd was on, but sometimes these sheep acted very stubborn and stupid. They would kick against the goads and would end up only hurting themselves. The goad was to help the sheep on the shepherd's journey, but sometimes the sheep had a journey of their own in mind. When you run from God's call, you only hurt yourself even more all while the shepherd wants to help you on the journey that Jesus has for your life.</p>

                    <p>Think about the modern day terrorists that go by the name ISIS. This terrorist group targets Christians and they are very cruel to the people they fight against; they are known for amputating their victim's body parts and cutting their heads off and parading their victim's dead bodies in the streets and for killing men, women, and children without remorse or regret. Many of the ISIS terrorists are from Assyria!</p>
                    <p>The Assyrians in Jonah's day were the modern day ISIS. They were very cruel to the Jewish people and they had no mercy for anyone; they brought terror and destruction wherever they went. I'm sure Jonah thought about all this when God told him to help the very people that were hurting Jonah's family and friends, and because of this he ran from his calling.</p>

                  <p className="mb-4">So the reason why Jonah was so against what God wanted him to do is because he was bitter. One of the biggest problems in the world in general and even in the church is bitterness. A bitter root doesn't just develop in a person's life over night; it all starts with a person being offended. Jesus even told us in the end times many people will be offended.</p>

                    <p>I read a book called "The Bait of Satan" by John Bevere. In this book the author explains the dangers of being offended and allowing the enemy to instill bitterness in a person's heart. The word for "offense" found in Matthew 24:10 is the greek word skandalon. It is where we get our English word for scandal. The word skandalon was also the name of a lever that sets off a trap and catches the victim in its claws because they fell for the bait that was connected to the lever.</p>
                    <p>People today don't realize that the enemy is trapping them in offense, which leads to bitterness because they keep falling for the bait of Satan. This comes in many forms, like maybe God didn't answer your prayer so now you're bitter at God. Or like a certain person didn't acknowledge you or didn't show you the affection you thought they should‚Äîlike a pastor that didn't do what you expected him to do, or a family member that didn't come through, or a friend that let you down. It might even be someone who hurt you or someone close to you, and what they did was their fault and you were truly an innocent victim of circumstance.</p>

                    <p>Whatever it is that offended you it then becomes a scandal! You start complaining about it and telling others how you were done wrong. The people that you tell don't know both sides of the story fully, so they side with you and then that makes you feel justified as if you are in the right about the wrong that was done to you.</p>
                    <p>Then the hurt sets in and you start having a pity party. How they did you wrong and how you don't deserve this treatment, and because of this you start getting angry. You're angry because it's not resolved and they haven't said they are sorry, and they feel that they're right and you're wrong. Anger then gives a foothold to the enemy: "for anger gives a foothold to the devil" (Ephesians 4:27 NLT). Always remember, if someone is controlling your feet they are also controlling your direction!</p>

                    <p>About two years before I answered the call to become a minister, one of the hardest things in my life happened to me. That was the enemy's way to try to make me become offended at God, angry at a person, and bitter because of what happened.</p>
                    <p>My mother was murdered and it was her husband, my stepfather that did it! He was a cruel, evil man that had accusations against him of murdering others in the past before he ever murdered my mother.</p>
                    <p>When I finally got to the hospital, I thought I was going to fight with this man that did this to my mother. I entered the hospital room and I saw my mother, who was only forty-one years old at the time, filled with hoses and connected to machines. There were scars on her arms and neck from what looked like a fight she was in.</p>
                    <p>As I was reading the Bible, moments later the man that put my mother in a coma and murdered her walked in! I got off my chair and stood up thinking I'm gonna fight with this man, but something happened‚ÄîGod filled me with peace and love; I couldn't believe it! I began to tell him about Jesus and how only Jesus could help my mother.</p>
                    <p>The day I had to sign the papers to pull the plug on the life support that was keeping my mother in a comatose state, I was in the room with my mother and he walked in. When I saw him I began to argue with him and told him I wasn't crazy and told him to get out of the room. As soon as he left the room, God began to minister to me to go and tell him I was sorry!</p>
                    <p>I said, "God, why would you want me to do this? You know what he did." God told me, "I'm going to use you to display my love through your forgiveness and obedience." I shook my head in amazement; I then walked out of the room, went up to him, and said I'm sorry!</p>
                    <p>If God gave me the strength to forgive and show love in a tragedy I believe He can give you the same strength as well. Ask and you will receive!</p>
