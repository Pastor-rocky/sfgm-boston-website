Chapter 1  Introduction
Jesus grows His Kingdom by growing His people. He gives leaders "to equip God's 
people to do His work and build up the church" so that together we mature into 
Christ and become "healthy and growing and full of love" (Ephesians 4:11–16). 
Growth is not accidental. It is a Spirit-led, Scripture-shaped journey that every 
believer can walk and every church can reproduce. Our pathway is simple and 
biblical: G.R.O.W.
Audi
Give: Offer your time, talents, and treasure to build people. Discipleship is 
scheduled love—showing up, serving, and investing.
Read: Feed daily on God's Word. Read, study, and meditate until you obey.
Obey: Listen to the Lord and apply His Word first in your own life. Obedience is 
better than sacrifice.
Win: Go, witness, and make disciples who make disciples.
As we grow ourselves in these four practices, we will be able to grow others—and 
God will grow His Kingdom through us. Open your Bible, open your schedule, and 
open your heart. Let's G.R.O.W.
Chapter 1: Give — Time, Talents, Treasure
"Growing ourselves, to Grow others, to Grow the Kingdom"
Ephesians 4:11-16
Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church: the apostles, the prophets, the 
evangelists, and the pastors and teachers. Their responsibility is to equip God's 
people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ. This will 
continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's Son 
that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard 
of Christ. Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won't be tossed 
and blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when 
people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth. Instead, we will 
speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the 
head of his body, the church. He makes the whole body fit together perfectly. As 
each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the 
whole body is healthy and growing and full of love.

We will learn how to grow the church and ourselves by looking at the word 
G.R.O.W. as an acronym.
Give: time, talents and treasure.
This section will talk about making the best use of your time for other people 
through discipleship programs.
Read: read, study and meditate.
This section will talk about setting aside daily devotions and sticking to them, also 
doing series based on daily readings so people will follow along.
Obey: listen, learn and apply.
This section will talk about being obedient to The Word for ourselves first because 
obedience is better than sacrifice—a lesson King Saul learned the hard way.
Win souls: witnessing, evangelizing and winning souls.
Give
In this section we will talk about the importance of discipleship and ways to help 
others do the same, by using our time, talents and treasure.
Deuteronomy 15:10 – "Give generously to him and do so without a grudging heart; 
then because of this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in 
everything you put your hand to."
Proverbs 22:9 – "He who is generous will be blessed, for he gives some of his food 
to the poor."
Luke 6:38 – "Give, and it will be given to you. They will pour into your lap a good 
measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over. For by your standard 
of measure it will be measured to you in return."
Give in Time, Talents and Treasure
Making time for others with your talents (gifts).
Colossians 4:5 "Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the 
time."
1 Peter 4:10 NIV "Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve 
others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms."

Rick Warren Says It Best, In Making the Most of Your Talents
"If you think your talents are simply for you to make a lot of money, retire, and die, 
you've missed the point of your life. God gave you talents to benefit others, not 
yourself. And God gave other people talents that benefit you. We're all a part of 
the body of Christ, and each part matters. There are no insignificant people in the 
family of God.
You are shaped to ser ve God, and he is testing you to see how you are going to 
use the talents he gave you. Whether you are a musician or an accountant, a 
teacher or a cook, God gave you those abilities to serve others.
Today's verse says, "Each of you should use whatever gift he has received to 
serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms" (1 Peter 
4:10 NIV).
You are a manager of the gifts God has given to you. They may be great or small in 
your eyes, but they matter to God. "Now it is required that those who have been 
given a trust must prove faithful" (1 Corinthians 4:2 NIV). When God made you, he 
made an investment in you, and he expects a return on that investment.
Are you using what He's given you for the benefit of others to make the world a 
better place? Or are you just using those talents to benefit yourself?
When God gives you a talent, he expects you to use it. It's like a muscle. If you use 
it, it will grow. If you don't, you'll lose it. If you have a talent but are afraid to use it, 
or if you get lazy and don't use it to benefit others, you're going to lose it. Like the 
parable of the ten talents in Luke 19, if you don't use what God has given you, he 
will take it away and give it to someone else who will.
But if you use your talents wisely, God will give you more. If you use your time 
wisely, God will give you more time. If you use your energy wisely, God will give 
you more energy. If you use your influence wisely, God will increase your influence. 
God will bless your level of faithfulness."
What Are We Doing in Our Churches That Will Produce Disciples?
"A church without discipleship is a church without Christ."
Jesus preached to thousands, left many to minister to one, but when the public 
ministry was done for the day, privately He discipled the twelve.
Some Ideas About Discipleship Programs

Leadership Classes: Teaching the people to become leaders.
Bible School: Teaching the people to read and properly study the Bible (with test 
papers and homework assignments—this is key to get them in the Bible).
Women's Ministry: This is very important because the Bible says the women are 
the weaker vessel (even if it's for prayer, worship, food and fellowship).
Youth Programs: Teenagers and young adults classes with teachings geared 
towards what they're struggling with (make sure it's a person that the youth will be 
comfortable with).
Kids Class: This is very important to a ministry. Have fun with it and use teachings 
geared towards what they need. Find someone that has a heart for kids and don't 
be afraid to have food and fun on certain days. (THIS GETS THE KIDS TO BRING 
THEIR FAMILIES!)
Some Ideas About Spending Time One on One or in Groups
Phone Calls Daily: Schedule at least three people you can call and just check up 
on, encourage, and pray with on a daily basis. Think about people that you know 
who are going through something and even people that have been faithful—you 
just want to say thank you and keep up the good work. (Change the people you 
call daily; even make a list.)
Personal Meetings: Schedule lunch or dinner meetings with people to just hang 
out and minister on a personal level where they will be able to open up to you and 
you can give them the Word they need for their personal situation. (Just you and 
them.)
Fellowship Meetings: Schedule times just to hang out with groups of people to 
show love and care to those you lead. It can be leaders, congregation and 
unbelievers. Make time to spend time with them and fellowship, then minister a 
short word with prayer at the end of the time together.
Note: It's always good to make a schedule the night before so you can have goals 
of who you want to call and/or visit.
Some Ideas About Giving Gifts (Treasure) as in Finances or Material Things
James 2:1-7 *My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ 
must not show favoritism. Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold 
ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in. If you 

show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good 
seat for you," but say to the poor man "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my 
feet," have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil 
thoughts?
Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in 
the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised 
those who love him? But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who are 
exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? Are they 
not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong?*
James 2:14-17 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have 
faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is 
without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, "Go in peace; keep 
warm and well fed," but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? 
In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
Look for those who are in need. You can personally help and/or the church can 
help as well. (Don't always look for a love offering and blessing if you're not willing 
to do the same for others. What you sow you will reap.)
Sow into ministries in need. It's always good to help other ministries. Paul the 
apostle was always getting the churches to help the other churches that were in 
need. (Explain Philippians 4:19—they were provided for because they were a giving 
church!)
Be a tithing Church. A church that gives out will receive in.
Have you noticed a difference since your church has been tithing? YES OR NO.
This section has covered some ways to help you always be a giver of time, talents 
and treasure. There are so many other ways to do this; always look for ways your 
ministry can GROW by giving!
