Chapter 2: Requirements
Calling answers why you are drawn to serve students. Requirements answer who 
you must become and what you must learn to serve them well. If calling is a seed, 
requirements are the soil and the gardener’s care—the conditions under which that 
seed can grow into a sturdy, fruitful tree. In youth ministry, your presence will often 
speak louder than your programs. Your character will preach before your sermon 
starts. Your spiritual life will overflow into the room, for good or for ill. This chapter 
clarifies the inner life and core competencies that form a trustworthy youth 
minister.
1) Character before competency
The first requirement of spiritual leadership is a life that is “above reproach.” 
Scripture paints a profile of sober-minded, faithful, self-controlled leaders whose 
homes, habits, and reputations align with their message (see 1 Timothy 3:1–7; 
Titus 1:5–9). That doesn’t mean perfection; it means integrity—wholeness—so that 
who you are in private and who you are in public are the same person. “Guard your 
heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life” (Proverbs 4:23). You 
cannot shepherd students toward holiness if you are casual with your own. Purity, 
honesty, gentleness, and faithfulness are not electives; they are prerequisites.
Character shows up in the small choices:
- Truth-telling when it costs you.
- Keeping confidences without hiding harm.
- Owning mistakes without excuse-making.
- Treating stress with prayer and rest rather than with secret escapes.
- Handling money with transparency and generosity.
John Bevere reminds us that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Awe 
purifies ambition and keeps us from playing games with sin. When you tremble at 
God’s Word, you stop looking for loopholes and start looking for likeness to Christ. 
Confession and repentance are not punishments; they are the pathway back to joy 
and power. “Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you 
may be healed” (James 5:16).
2) Spiritual vitality: live what you invite students into
The most essential ministry strategy is abiding in Christ. “Apart from me you can 
do nothing,” Jesus says (John 15:5). Youth ministry requires energy, creativity, and 
patience, but none of these can substitute for a living connection with the Vine. 
Build an honest, sustainable rule of life—habits that keep you near Jesus:
- Scripture: not only for teaching prep, but for feeding your soul. “Work hard so 
you can present yourself to God... one who correctly explains the word of truth” (2 
Timothy 2:15).

- Prayer: adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and intercession. Keep a list of 
students and leaders and pray names, not just numbers.
- Sabbath and rest: receive God’s gift of limits. “Come to me... and I will give you 
rest” (Matthew 11:28–29).
- Fasting: let hunger for God reorder lesser hungers.
- Community: spiritual friends and mentors who ask you real questions.
Bevere’s emphasis on holy reverence will guard your devotional life from becoming 
a ritual devoid of relationship. Reverence births obedience; obedience keeps the 
channel of fellowship clear.
3) Relational credibility: trust is your first platform
Students follow leaders they trust. John Maxwell’s Five Levels of Leadership 
highlight that early influence rests at Level 2—Permission—where people follow 
because they want to, not because they have to. You earn that permission through 
consistent presence, empathy, and reliability. Learn names. Show up at games and 
performances. Ask questions and listen. Celebrate small wins. Keep your word, 
even about small things. Trust is slow to build and quick to lose.
Relational credibility extends to parents and volunteers. Communicate calendar 
plans early. Respond to messages in a timely, respectful way. Align with your 
senior leadership and keep them in the loop. Honor parents’ role as primary 
disciple-makers by partnering, not competing—equip them with conversation 
guides after big teaching series, and invite their feedback.
Boundaries protect trust. Keep conversations with students observable and 
interruptible. Use the “two-adult rule” for meetings and transportation. Maintain 
appropriate physical and digital boundaries. Document pastoral care notes 
securely. These are not signs of suspicion; they are acts of wisdom that protect 
students, you, and the church.
4) Biblical and preaching competence: truth with clarity and grace
Youth workers handle Scripture in a way that is both faithful and accessible. Tony 
Evans emphasizes that our authority comes from God’s Word empowered by the 
Spirit, not from our personalities. Aim for messages that are:
- Text-driven: the main point of the passage becomes the main point of the 
message.
- Christ-centered: lead students to Jesus, not just to moral advice.
- Clear and concrete: one big idea, a few memorable handles, and specific next 
steps.
- Pastoral: speak to real questions students face (identity, anxiety, temptation, 
friendship, technology) with biblical wisdom and compassion.
A simple pattern helps: Pray the text, explain the text, illustrate the text, apply the 

text. Let Scripture interpret students’ lives, not the other way around. Shepherd, 
don’t show off. “Preach the word of God. Be prepared, whether the time is 
favorable or not. Patiently correct, rebuke, and encourage” (2 Timothy 4:2).
5) Leadership and management: lift the lid
Maxwell’s Law of the Lid says your leadership capacity sets the ceiling of your 
ministry’s impact. Youth ministry requires planning, prioritizing, and people 
development:
- Vision and priorities: define the win—disciples who know Jesus, belong to His 
people, and join His mission. Program your calendar to those outcomes, not to 
busyness.
- Systems: a simple follow-up pipeline for new students; a plan for small group 
placement; a clear pathway from first-time visitor to serving student.
- Teams: recruit, train, and empower volunteers. “Two people are better off than 
one” (Ecclesiastes 4:9–10). Build an inner circle that shares your values and 
complements your weaknesses.
- Communication: clear, multi-channel messaging to students, parents, and 
leaders. Over-communicate long before events.
- Stewardship: budget with integrity. Spend on disciple-making priorities. Track 
attendance and care contacts, not just for metrics but for shepherding.
The Law of Priorities reminds you that activity is not accomplishment. Do the first 
things first: prayer, people, preparation. The Law of the Inner Circle reminds you 
that those closest to you determine much of your potential—choose wisely.
6) Emotional health and resilience: lead from overflow, not from exhaustion
Ministry is joyful and weighty. You will carry stories of pain, walk with students 
through crisis, and absorb criticism. Unaddressed stress becomes a doorway to 
unwise coping. Build rhythms that sustain you: sleep, exercise, fun, spiritual 
friendship, and regular retreats. Normalize counseling and spiritual direction. 
Name what you’re feeling and bring it to God and trusted people. “A cheerful heart 
is good medicine” (Proverbs 17:22), but that cheerfulness is not denial; it’s the 
fruit of God’s presence in an honest life.
Keep special attention on moral integrity in three areas:
- Sexual purity: flee temptation, guard your digital life, and invite accountability. 
“Run from sexual sin!” (1 Corinthians 6:18).
- Financial integrity: receipts, transparency, and church-approved systems for 
purchases and reimbursements.
- Speech: no sarcasm that shames, no gossip that erodes trust, no promises you 
can’t keep. “Let everything you say be good and helpful” (Ephesians 4:29).
7) Cultural wisdom and safety
Students live in a digital world. Learn their platforms without trying to be a copy of 

them. Teach digital discipleship—wisdom about identity, comparison, and time 
stewardship. Prepare your team for trauma-informed care: how to listen, how to 
recognize when to refer, and how to report appropriately. Know your church’s 
policies for background checks, reporting abuse, transportation, medical forms, 
and medication handling. Safety is discipleship—students cannot hear the gospel 
well in unsafe environments. “Be sure that everything is done properly and in 
order” (1 Corinthians 14:40).
8) Alignment with the church and a learner’s posture
Youth ministry is a ministry of the church, not a church within the church. Align 
your mission, teaching, and calendar with your leaders. Seek regular feedback. 
“Let the wise listen and become even wiser” (Proverbs 1:5). Teach students to love 
the whole church—multi-generational worship, service, and membership. You are 
preparing them not just for youth group, but for a lifetime with Jesus and His 
people.
Requirements can feel heavy until you remember the order of grace: Jesus invites 
you to abide, and then He empowers you to obey. The Spirit who calls you also 
forms you. Your job is not to manufacture holiness or competence, but to 
cooperate with God’s forming work—daily, humbly, joyfully. Build the trellis, and 
the Vine will grow.
