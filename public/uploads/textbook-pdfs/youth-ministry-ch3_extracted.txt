Chapter 3: Responsibilities
If calling is the “why” and requirements are the “who,” responsibilities are the 
“what” and “how” of youth ministry. This is where vision touches the calendar, 
where sermons become shepherding, and where systems become service. Think 
of your ministry as a table. Four sturdy legs hold it steady: the Word and prayer, 
people, teams, and wise planning. If any leg weakens, the table wobbles. Your 
charge is not to juggle a hundred tasks but to keep those legs strong so students 
can feast on the life of Jesus.
A faithful week is not glamorous. It’s unhurried time with God (Acts 6:4), attentive 
time with students (1 Thessalonians 2:8), careful crafting of God’s Word so 
students can hear and obey (2 Timothy 4:2), and thoughtful leadership that equips 
others to do the work of ministry (Ephesians 4:12). John Maxwell calls this the Law 
of Priorities: activity is not accomplishment. Tony Evans reminds us that preaching 
carries weight because it carries the Word, not because it carries our personality. 
John Bevere urges us to minister with holy awe, which keeps the work from 
becoming a performance. Hold those three voices together as you carry out the 
core responsibilities below.
1) Preaching and teaching: truth that aims at transformation
Preaching to students requires both reverence and relevance. Your goal is not to 
say everything, but to say the right thing clearly, faithfully, and pastorally. A simple 
weekly rhythm helps:
- Pray first. Before you study the text, let the text study you. Ask what God wants 
to form in students through this passage. “Let the message about Christ... fill your 
lives” (Colossians 3:16).
- Find the big idea. What is this text saying? Aim for one clear sentence that a 
ninth grader can repeat.
- Build toward response. Ask, “If this is true, what should students believe 
differently? Feel differently? Do differently?” Preach Christ, not merely advice 
(Colossians 1:28–29).
Tony Evans emphasizes clarity with conviction. Explain the text, illustrate with 
stories from student life, and call for a faith-filled step—prayer, confession, 
reconciliation, mission. Keep your tone warm, your words simple, and your 
applications specific. Over time, plan a balanced teaching calendar: gospel, 
identity in Christ, spiritual disciplines, relationships, wisdom, mission, and justice. 
A healthy preaching plan anticipates the school year rhythms and gives room for 
small group dialogue and Q&A nights.
2) Small groups and a discipleship pathway
Students grow best in circles, not just in rows. A small group is the place where 

teaching becomes transformation—where someone knows your name, your 
questions, and your week. Build a simple, consistent pathway:
- Groups anchored to Scripture and real life. Use questions that help students 
observe, interpret, and apply God’s Word. Invite honest stories and guide toward 
hope.
- Trained leaders. Recruit faithful adults who love Jesus and teenagers. Equip 
them to listen well, ask wise questions, and follow up during the week (2 Timothy 
2:2).
- Clear expectations. Provide a short leader guide with the big idea, three to five 
discussion questions, and two concrete follow-ups: one spiritual (e.g., a reading 
plan) and one relational (e.g., check-in midweek).
- Relational safety. Keep groups predictable, on time, and trustworthy. Leaders 
should protect confidentiality while understanding when to report safety concerns.
Measure what matters. Don’t obsess over group size; track engagement, spiritual 
conversations, Scripture intake, prayer, and acts of service. Celebrate small group 
wins publicly so students see that growth is more than a crowd count.
3) Pastoral care and follow-up
Shepherds know the state of their flock (Proverbs 27:23). Create simple systems 
that help love stay organized:
- New student follow-up. Within 48 hours, send a welcoming text, a parent email, 
and an invite to next week. Thank them for coming by name. Offer to answer 
questions.
- Response follow-up. When students respond to a message—salvation, renewed 
commitment, confession—follow up personally within a few days. Help them take a 
next step: baptism class, a Bible reading plan, joining a small group, or meeting 
with a leader.
- Crisis care. Listen first, pray sincerely, and involve parents and pastors 
appropriately. Know when to refer to professional counselors. Have a clear 
reporting protocol for any safety concerns (Galatians 6:2; James 1:19).
- Prayer. Keep a running prayer list. Text students short Scripture-rooted prayers 
midweek. Few things communicate care like remembering.
Document care contacts briefly and securely. You’re not building a dossier; you’re 
stewarding souls. Your notes help you follow through and help your team stay 
unified.
4) Partnering with parents and the wider church
Parents are the primary disciple-makers. Your role is to partner, not replace. Build 
trust by communicating early and often:
- Monthly parent update. Share the teaching plan, key dates, and a simple 
conversation guide so faith continues at home (Deuteronomy 6:6–7).
- Open doors. Invite parents to observe, serve, or attend special nights. Seek 

feedback with humility.
- Bridge to the church. Encourage students to worship, serve, and belong in the 
life of the whole church, not only in the youth room (1 Peter 5:2; Acts 2:42–47).
Alignment matters. Sync your calendar and series with church leadership. Invite 
your senior pastor to speak occasionally. Let students see themselves as part of a 
larger family.
5) Volunteer development: from doer to developer
If you do all the ministry, your impact will always be limited. If you develop people, 
your ministry multiplies. Maxwell’s Five Levels of Leadership call you to move from 
Position to Permission to Production, but the long-term fruit comes at Level 4: 
People Development. Build a simple pipeline:
- Recruit with vision and clarity. Explain why their presence matters and what the 
role actually involves.
- Onboard with care. Background checks, clear expectations, and a warm welcome 
go a long way.
- Train consistently. Short, regular huddles beat occasional marathons. Teach one 
skill at a time: how to lead prayer, how to follow up, how to handle tough 
questions.
- Coach and celebrate. Give specific feedback after nights. Share stories of life 
change and say thank you often.
Aim to delegate real responsibility, not just tasks. Let leaders own a small group, a 
prayer team, a welcome process, or an outreach project. “Equip God’s people to 
do his work and build up the church” (Ephesians 4:12).
6) Outreach and mission: seeking and sending
A healthy ministry both gathers and goes. Jesus tells stories of pursuing the one 
who is lost (Luke 15). Help students see school hallways and digital spaces as 
mission fields:
- Invite culture. Teach students to pray for three friends, invest in those 
friendships, and invite them to a next step—a night, a small group, or a service 
opportunity.
- Service and justice. Plan regular service projects that meet tangible needs. 
Debrief biblically so students connect mercy with the gospel.
- Evangelism training. Offer simple tools for sharing the hope within them with 
gentleness and respect (1 Peter 3:15).
- Missions pathway. Partner with your church’s local and global efforts. A well-led 
trip or local immersion can mark a student for life.
7) Administration and stewardship: order that serves love
Good systems free you to love people. Keep administration simple and 
transparent:

- Calendar. Work six to nine months ahead. Mark key rhythms: retreats, camps, 
outreach, parent nights, leader trainings, and rest weeks.
- Budget. Spend to your values. Track expenses carefully. Ask, “Does this 
purchase help us make disciples?”
- Safety. Background checks, two-adult rule, check-in procedures, medical forms, 
transportation guidelines, and incident reporting. “Be sure that everything is done 
properly and in order” (1 Corinthians 14:40).
- Metrics that matter. Beyond attendance, track first-time guests, follow-up 
touches, small group participation, baptisms, Scripture reading plans started, 
service engagement, and leader retention. Numbers are servants, not masters. 
They help you notice where to celebrate and where to lean in.
8) A sustainable weekly rhythm
Responsibilities are carried by rhythms, not heroic bursts. Consider a simple 
weekly template (adjust to your context):
- Day of rest and worship: stop, delight, and recharge.
- Sermon prep block: study, pray, and write while you’re fresh.
- People blocks: campus visits, one-on-ones, small group leader huddles.
- Team block: planning and communication with staff and volunteers.
- Admin block: calendar, budget, forms, and follow-up.
- Margin: space for the unexpected conversation or crisis.
Guard your first things: time with God, time with your family, time with your team. 
“Teach us to realize the brevity of life, so that we may grow in wisdom” (Psalm 
90:12). Wisdom allocates time to match calling.
When you hold these responsibilities with reverent awe, relational warmth, and 
wise planning, students experience a ministry that feels both alive and safe—alive 
because the Word and Spirit are at work, safe because love is well-ordered. Your 
task is not to be everywhere or do everything, but to be faithful with what truly 
matters and to equip others to join you.
Weekly Challenge (Week 3: Responsibilities)
- Day 1: Map your ministry week
- Sketch a weekly schedule that protects sermon prep, people time, team time, 
admin, and rest. Choose three non-negotiables you’ll keep for the next 30 days.
- Day 2: Preaching sprint
- Choose an upcoming passage. Write one clear big idea, three student-centered 
applications, and one response step. Share it with a mentor for feedback on clarity 
and faithfulness.
- Day 3: Small group health check
- List each current small group and its leader. For five students, note one spiritual 
next step and one relational follow-up this week. Send those notes to leaders and 
check back in seven days.

- Day 4: Follow-up flow
- Build a 48-hour follow-up workflow for new students and for salvation/response 
cards. Draft two text templates and one parent email. Test them with a trusted 
leader for tone.
- Day 5: Parent and volunteer touchpoints
- Draft next month’s parent update with a short conversation guide. Create a 30-
minute mini-training for leaders (topic: leading great discussions). Put both on the 
calendar and send invites.
Deliverables to bring into Week 4
- Your weekly rhythm with three non-negotiables.
- One-page sermon plan (big idea, applications, response).
- Small group health notes with next steps.
- Follow-up templates and workflow diagram.
- Parent update draft and leader training outline.
Next Week Preview (Week 4: Accountability)
We will build the guardrails that keep leaders and students safe and fruitful: 
personal accountability, team feedback loops, financial and safety accountability, 
doctrinal clarity, and measurable outcomes that serve people rather than pressure 
them. We’ll explore how to invite correction, practice confession, report wisely, 
and create a culture where truth and grace grow together.
