 Chapter 1: The Calling
When God calls a young person, He rarely does it with fanfare. More often, He 
whispers. In the quiet, He stirs a heart to pay attention to what He’s doing among 
the next generation. If you’re reading this, perhaps you’ve sensed that whisper: a 
burden for students who are searching, a desire to teach God’s Word so it lands 
like fire, a conviction that your life is meant to be poured out for the good of teens 
and the glory of God. Calling, especially to youth ministry, is God’s invitation to 

partner with Him in shaping future disciples and leaders. It is holy, humbling, and 
deeply hopeful.
The stories of Samuel, David, and Timothy show us that God loves to entrust 
significant work to young people. Their age did not disqualify them; it made them 
dependent on God. And dependence is the soil where calling grows.
Samuel’s night in the temple is a picture of the beginning of ministry: a child in a 
sacred place learning to recognize the Lord’s voice (1 Samuel 3). Samuel didn’t 
know it was God at first. He needed Eli, an older priest, to help him discern. That 
detail matters. Calling ripens in community and under mentorship. Samuel’s simple 
response—“Speak, Lord; Your servant is listening”—is the first posture of a called 
leader: open-handed, attentive, ready to obey. Many aspiring ministers rush 
toward what to do. Samuel shows us to start with whom we’re hearing. As John 
Bevere emphasizes in The Awe of God, reverent fear of the Lord tunes our ears 
and cleanses our motives. The awe of God is not terror but trembling trust. You will 
hear God more clearly when you want His pleasure more than you want a platform.
David’s anointing offers another layer. He was overlooked by family and invisible to 
power brokers. Yet God saw what mattered—the heart (1 Samuel 16). Before David 
held a sword, he held a harp; before he sat on a throne, he watched sheep. The 
hidden years are not wasted years. They are God’s leadership school. John 
Maxwell calls this the Law of the Process: leadership develops daily, not in a day. If 
your call to youth ministry feels like a slow burn—faithfully leading a small group of 
four students, stacking chairs after service, learning to prepare a simple Bible 
study—remember David. Private victories come before public ones. The ceiling of 
your future ministry (Maxwell’s Law of the Lid) will be raised as you let God shape 
your character now. The flock in your care—no matter how small—is the flock 
where you learn to shepherd hearts, not manage crowds.
Timothy, Paul’s young protégé, rounds out the picture. He had a godly heritage, 
spiritual gifts, and a mentor who believed in him. But Timothy also faced criticism 
because of his youth. Paul’s counsel was not to demand respect but to live in such 
a way that respect would be the natural response (1 Timothy 4:12). “Set the 
believers an example,” Paul urged, in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity. That 
five-fold pattern is a roadmap for every emerging youth minister. Your words 
shape culture. Your actions build credibility. Your love earns permission (Maxwell’s 
Five Levels of Leadership, Level 2: Permission). Your faith sustains you when fruit 
seems slow. Your purity protects the integrity of your influence. Paul also told 
Timothy to fan into flame the gift God had given him (2 Timothy 1:6–7). Gifts can 
grow cold without use. Calling isn’t a certificate you frame; it’s a fire you steward.
What, then, is a calling? Biblically, calling is God’s initiative to bring you into His 
purpose. It includes identity (called to belong to Jesus), character (called to be 

holy), and assignment (called to a specific work among specific people). Your 
calling to youth ministry is an assignment within your larger calling to Christ. That 
ordering matters. If you root your identity in your role, you’ll ride the rollercoaster 
of attendance spikes and social media feedback. If you root your identity in being 
adopted by God and faithful to Him, your ministry will rest on a rock. John Bevere 
would say the fear of the Lord creates that rock. It purifies ambition and fuels 
obedience. You begin to ask different questions: “What honors God?” instead of 
“What grows my brand?” “What forms students in Christ?” instead of “What gets 
the biggest laugh?”
Because calling comes from God, it has both internal and external confirmations. 
Internally, the Holy Spirit burdens your heart for students, awakens desire to serve, 
and highlights Scriptures that shape your sense of assignment (Romans 12; 1 
Corinthians 12). Externally, the church recognizes and affirms what God is doing. 
This includes mentors who speak truth (like Eli did for Samuel), leaders who invite 
you to serve (like Paul did for Timothy), and observable fruit over time. If you think 
you’re called to teach, do students actually learn and respond when you teach? If 
you feel called to shepherd, do students open up to you, and do you follow 
through with care? Calling without community can drift into self-deception. 
Community without calling can drift into mere busyness. You need both.
The preaching task sits at the center of youth ministry because students need to 
encounter God through His Word. Tony Evans emphasizes that preaching draws its 
authority from God’s Word empowered by the Spirit, not from the preacher’s 
personality. Youth ministry preaching must be clear enough for a ninth grader to 
grasp and deep enough to feed a senior who’s already leading peers. It must be 
faithful to the text and focused on transformation. Remember, your message is not 
merely information transfer; it’s an invitation to surrender to Jesus. Preaching with 
integrity starts in the secret place—with prayer, repentance, and the awe of God—
and moves into the public place—with clarity, love, and urgency.
Common pitfalls stalk the called. One is confusing emotion with vocation. A 
moving conference moment may awaken you, but only time, fruit, and counsel can 
confirm you. Another is chasing a platform. Jesus invested in twelve, not in 
metrics. If you aim at being impressive, you will neglect being faithful. A third is 
isolation. Lone rangers are vulnerable to error and burnout. Youth ministry is a 
team sport: parents, volunteers, pastors, and peers all matter. Maxwell’s Law of 
the Inner Circle applies here: your potential is determined by those closest to you. 
Choose mentors and teammates who love Jesus and love students.
So how do you discern and respond to calling? Start with listening. Set aside quiet 
space, put your phone away, and ask God what He’s saying about the students in 
your community. Then test what you hear. Take a gifts inventory based on Romans 
12 and 1 Corinthians 12; ask others where they see fruit in your life. Next, seek 

external confirmation. Schedule conversations with your pastor or youth leader. Be 
ready to receive both affirmation and direction for growth. Finally, obey in small, 
concrete steps. Say yes to serving where you are. Prepare diligently even when 
you’re teaching five students. Follow up with the freshman who’s drifting. 
Faithfulness in little is the training ground for faithfulness in much.
As you take those steps, keep your soul anchored. The awe of God keeps you 
honest. Daily Scripture keeps you grounded. Prayer keeps you connected. 
Journaling keeps you reflective. Fasting sharpens your hunger for God more than 
for success. Serving behind the scenes keeps you humble. And reading wise 
voices keeps you growing. Consider pairing your Bible reading this week with 
selections from The Awe of God (for your posture), The 21 Irrefutable Laws of 
Leadership (for your process), The 5 Levels of Leadership (for your relationships), 
and The Power of Preaching (for your proclamation). Let them mentor you as you 
walk with the Lord and with His people.
Picture the students you hope to serve. Some are skeptical. Some are wounded. 
Some are hungry for truth. Some are bored. God sees them all. He is already at 
work in their lives, and He may be inviting you to join Him. That invitation is not to 
become a celebrity but to become a shepherd. It’s a call to lay down your life—
your preferences, your time, your ego—so that students can find life in Christ. It’s 
a call to carry God’s Word in your mouth and God’s heart in your chest. It’s a call to 
endure, to rejoice, to pray, to laugh, to weep, and to wait on the Lord. It’s a call 
worthy of your whole life.

you. If He places you, He will sustain you. Your part is to respond as Samuel did: 
“Speak, Lord; Your servant is listening.” Then, like David, be faithful in hidden 
places. Like Timothy, guard your life and doctrine closely. And like Paul, learn to 
labor with God’s energy, which powerfully works within you. The journey begins 
here, with awe, humility, and a willing yes.
Weekly Challenge (Week 1: The Calling)
- Day 1: Listening Retreat (60 minutes)
- Read 1 Samuel 3 and 1 Timothy 4:6–16. In silence, ask: “Lord, what are You 
saying to me about youth?” Journal impressions and Scriptures that come to mind.
- Day 2: Gifts and Fruit Inventory
- Review Romans 12:4–8 and 1 Corinthians 12. List 3–5 gifts you may have and 2–3 
places you’ve seen fruit with students. Ask one trusted friend to add their 
observations.
- Day 3: Mentor Conversations
- Meet with your pastor/youth leader and one mature believer. Ask: “Do you see a 

ministry call in me? Where should I stretch? What’s one assignment I can take on 
now?”
- Day 4: Serve Small
- Volunteer in a youth ministry task this week (lead prayer, co-lead a small group, 
follow up with a new student, organize a service project). Note what energized 
you, what challenged you, and how students responded.
- Day 5: Calling Statement
- Write 3–4 sentences summarizing your sense of calling, your primary audience 
(which students), and your next faithful step in the next 30 days. Share it with your 
mentor for feedback.
Deliverables to bring into Week 2
- Written calling statement.
- Notes from both mentor conversations.
- One clear next step you will take in the next 30 days.
Next Week Preview (Week 2: Requirements)
Calling is the “why.” Requirements are the “who you must become” and “what you 
must learn.” In Week 2, we will explore biblical character qualifications, spiritual 
disciplines, relational competencies, and practical skills required for youth 
ministry. 
Drawing from 1 Timothy and Titus, insights from John Maxwell on personal growth 
and credibility, John Bevere on holiness and the fear of the Lord, and Tony Evans 
on handling God’s Word, you will craft a personal development plan to steward 
your calling with integrity.
