Chapter 10 Conclusion
“Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah unto 
Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of 
hosts.” (Zechariah 4:6)
Zerubbabel was helping restore the temple but faced opposition. God gave 
Zechariah a vision of a golden lampstand fed directly by two olive trees—oil 
flowing straight into the lamps—then said, “Not by might, nor by power, but by my 
Spirit.” In the temple, priests kept the lamps filled with oil so the fire would 
continually burn. The vision shows that God can supply His own oil and His own 
fire; yet He invites us to serve. Today we are the temple, the priesthood, and the 
living sacrifice. Our part is to maintain the anointing through obedience.
If you apply the seven keys from this book, you will find it far easier to keep the 
flame burning:
The Word of God daily
Eyes free from lust
Passing the tests
Time in prayer
Time in fasting
Godly fellowship
Spreading the Word by witnessing
God does not need us—He could set two olive trees beside every lamp—but He 
wants to use us. We must submit. Recently, during a two-day revival at our church, 
the choir sang, “Lord, I am broken in pieces, but your strength is perfect in all of 
my weakness.” As we worshiped, a bottle of anointing oil fell from the pulpit and 
shattered. No one touched it. The fragrance filled the sanctuary, reminding me of 
the woman who broke the alabaster jar to anoint Jesus (John 12). I believe the 
Lord illustrated this truth: when we allow Him to break us and rely on His strength, 
the anointing flows, and a beautiful fragrance rises to Him—and to the world. In the 
days that followed, testimonies came: an eye surgery was canceled because it was 
no longer needed; a cancer was found contained and removed without spread; a 
servant received the gift of tongues; many rededicated their lives and were set on 
fire.
If we refuse to be broken, we hinder the anointing and give off a foul odor. “Dead 
flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor; so doth a little folly 
outweigh wisdom and honor.” (Ecclesiastes 10:1) In Moses’ day, the apothecary 
compounded the holy anointing oil used to consecrate the tabernacle and priests 
(Exodus 30:25). If flies fell into the jars, the perfume spoiled. Jesus called Satan 

“Beelzebub” (lord of the flies). If we cling to “flies” like gossip, slander, 
unforgiveness, anger, offenses, bitterness, lust, adultery, pornography, greed, lies, 
addictions, and the like, we will never burn brightly. Get the flies out and yield to 
the Spirit: “Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.” 
God wants to use you to spread His fire; if you truly seek Him, He will set you on 
fire—so people will come watch you burn.
History bears witness. In 1906, at Azusa Street in Los Angeles, a great awakening 
erupted. Pastors and leaders came from around the world; they carried the flame 
home, kindling Pentecostal fires in their nations. Today, hundreds of millions trace 
their spiritual heritage to that move, with tens of thousands coming to Christ daily. 
During one Azusa meeting, firemen reportedly arrived because onlookers saw 
flames atop the building. There was no natural fire—God allowed them to glimpse 
the spiritual blaze. If He sent fire on the disciples in the upper room and at Azusa 
Street, He can and will do it for you. “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, 
and forever.” (Hebrews 13:8)
Everyone who truly gets on fire and stays on fire spreads that fire for God’s glory. 
D. L. Moody said, “We are told to let our light shine, and if it does, we won’t need 
to tell anybody it does. Lighthouses don’t fire cannons to call attention to their 
shining—they just shine.” “The winds are your messengers, and flames of fire are 
your servants.” (Psalm 104:4) Allow God to break and anoint your life so you can 
get set on fire, stay on fire, and spread the fire of God.
Go start some fires!
