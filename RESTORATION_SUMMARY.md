# Restoration Summary - October 27, 2025

## Problem

- Website deployed to Railway but **no course content showing** (no videos, quizzes, readings)
- Repository had 35+ documentation files causing confusion
- Database on Railway was empty (no seed data)
- Looking for Oct 10 backup that didn't exist in Git

## Solution

### 1. Git History Investigation
- Repository only started Oct 21 (first commit)
- No Oct 10 backup exists
- Course files exist locally (dated Oct 8-17) but weren't in Git
- Found 63 total commits in history

### 2. Selected Recovery Point
- **Commit `78171c1`** - Oct 27, 10:07 AM
- Title: "Add all course content: videos, quizzes, textbooks, and audio files for all 6 courses"
- **This was the last working state with all content**

### 3. Restoration Actions
```bash
git checkout 78171c1          # Restore to working commit
git switch main
git reset --hard 78171c1      # Reset main branch
git push origin main --force   # Force push to Railway
```

### 4. Current Status

✅ **Code Restored**: All files back to working state (Oct 27, 10:07 AM)
✅ **Railway Deploying**: Auto-deploy triggered by force push
⏳ **Database Seeding Needed**: Must run seed scripts on Railway

## Next Steps

You MUST run these commands in Railway shell:

```bash
npm run seed:videos              # Add all videos
npm run seed:quizzes:acts        # Add Acts quizzes
npm run seed:quizzes:firestarter # Add Fire Starter quizzes
npm run seed:quizzes:grow        # Add G.R.O.W quizzes
npm run seed:quizzes:studying    # Add Studying for Service quizzes
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Git history only goes back to Oct 21** - no earlier backups
2. **Course files were never fully committed** - existed locally but not in Git
3. **Database on Railway was never seeded** - that's why content missing
4. **35+ documentation files created confusion** - cleanup was necessary

## Files Restored

All course content files from commit `78171c1`:
- `public/course-assets/` - All course videos, audio, images
- `seed-*` scripts - Database seeding scripts
- Server configuration - Working deployment setup

## Important Commands

### Access Railway Shell:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Open your project → service
3. Deployments → "..." → Shell

### Run in Railway Shell:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
npm run seed:videos
npm run seed:quizzes:acts
npm run seed:quizzes:firestarter
npm run seed:quizzes:grow
npm run seed:quizzes:studying
```

## Questions?

If course 1 still shows no content after seeding, check:
1. Railway deployment logs for errors
2. Database connection in Railway
3. Static files are being served from `/public/course-assets/`
