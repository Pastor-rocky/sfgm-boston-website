## ✅ Database Seeding Order

Updated `reseed-courses.ts` to seed courses in the correct order:
1. Acts in Action
2. Becoming a Firestarter
3. Don't Be a Jonah
4. G.R.O.W Beginner Course
5. Studying for Service
6. Deaconship Course
7. Level Up Leadership
8. Youth Ministry Course

This matches the original frontend course IDs.

## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED

The database currently has courses seeded in the wrong order from our first deployment attempt.

**To fix this, run:**
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="your-database-url" && npx tsx reseed-courses.ts
```

This will delete all existing courses and reseed them in the correct order, matching the frontend course ID expectations.
