# SFGM Boston Bible School - PRODUCTION READINESS GUIDE
*Final Resolution: July 28, 2025 at 11:01 PM*

## ✅ AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM COMPLETELY FIXED

### Root Cause Identified and Resolved:
**Problem**: Token storage mismatch between frontend (`auth_token`) and backend (`authToken`)
**Solution**: Backend now accepts both token formats for complete compatibility

### Technical Fix Applied:
- Modified `/api/auth/user` endpoint to check multiple token sources
- Updated login endpoint to set tokens in both formats (`authToken` and `auth_token`)
- Enhanced authentication middleware to handle all token storage methods
- All existing student tokens now work seamlessly

## 🎯 CURRENT STUDENT STATUS (ALL OPERATIONAL)

### Students Ready to Enroll:
1. **Joe Kaslov** - `joe kaslov` / `kaslov123` ✅ Can login and enroll
2. **Spike** - `Spike` / `Sneaker781` ✅ Can login and enroll (just enrolled in course)
3. **Deacon Robert** - `Deaconrobert97` / `Jasnickmat3` ✅ Fully active (8+ courses)
4. **Cody Jace** - `Cody dannys` / `Cody8123` ✅ Can login and enroll
5. **Terry Mitchell** - `Terry123` / `terry123` ✅ Can login and enroll
6. **Larry Kaslov** - `jtkaslov42` / `kaslov42` ✅ Can login and enroll
7. **Test Student** - `teststudent123` / `TestPass123!` ✅ Can login and enroll
